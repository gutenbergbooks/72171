      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Dear Young Readers from Nine to Ninety</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In writing this book we have not tried to write a history
but rather have attempted to follow a lane parallel to the
road along which music has marched down to us through
the ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>For this reason you will find what may seem upon first
glance peculiar omissions, but which to us were prayerfully
and carefully relinquished, lest the book become an encyclopedia
and lest our kind publisher look upon us ungraciously
and our readers despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the omissions which may be regarded as serious
is a chapter on the singers, those who have delighted and
thrilled the public through the years, but the nature of this
book, in the minds of its authors, precludes details of the
executive side of music, adhering as closely as possible to
the actual creators.</p>

<p class='c008'>In our experience every history of music, and we have
read scores of them, leaves out many things, so our “lane”
touches things in passing, only, owing to mechanical as well
as willful reasons.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand we have enlarged greatly on many
topics. This we have done when we have considered a
subject particularly picturesque in order to attract and
stimulate the novice reading about music, perhaps, for
the first time!</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly we have tried to explain as simply as possible,
without becoming infantile, the varying steps in Music’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>growth. Therefore, the book has assumed larger proportions
than if we had been able to use scientific terms and cut the
Gordian knot of explanation with one swiftly aimed blow,
rather than three or four.</p>

<p class='c008'>So, with the sincere hope that our book will help you to
love music better, because you will have seen its struggle
with politics, religion and its critics, we leave you to read
it—from cover to cover—we hope!</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Our book has had friends other than its authors. It
has, in fact, had makers as well as authors, so it
cannot go out into the world without proclaiming its
“thank-yous.” First it would thank Flora Bernstein, its
indefatigable and patient typist, editor and general adviser,
who worked night and day for many moons; second, it
must thank Dorothy Lawton of the Music Library of the
City of New York for her graceful but poignant criticism,
and third it must thank Grace Bliss Stewart, who did some
research and anything needed.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>No one questions the need of histories of music. Few,
however, define the need. It seems to be generally
agreed that people ought to know something about
the history of the principal arts. Who designed St. Peter’s,
who painted the <cite>Descent from the Cross</cite>, who wrote <cite>The
Faerie Queen</cite> and who composed the <cite>Ninth Symphony</cite>.
These are things one ought to know. The reasons why
one ought to know them are seldom made clear. But
just at this time, when the word “appreciation” is so active
in the world’s conversation, there should be little difficulty
in separating from the mass of unformed comment at
least one reason for acquaintance with the history of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one can “appreciate” an art work without knowing
its period, the state of the art in that period, the ideals and
purposes of composers, the capacity of their public and
the particular gifts and aims of the writer of the work
under consideration. It is extremely difficult for any
person to begin the study of “appreciation” after he is old
enough to have acquired a stock of prejudices and burdened
his mind with a heavy load of misconceptions. It is
better to absorb good art, music or other, in the early years
and to grow up with it than to try at 18 or 20 to put away
childish things and understand Bach’s “St. Matthew
Passion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Bauer and Miss Peyser have written a history of
music for young people. It is not for the kindergarten
class and yet it is not out of the reach of mere children. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>is not for the seniors in a university and yet they might
profit by examining it. The authors have surveyed the
entire field. They have touched ancient music and the
music of nations not usually considered in some more
pretentious histories. They have apparently tried to
give a bird’s-eye view of the art as practiced by all the
civilized and some of the uncivilized races of the earth.
With this in mind they have shown how the supreme
art forms and the greatest art works developed among the
western European peoples, who, it is interesting to note,
produced also the metaphysical and philosophical bases
of the world’s scientific thought, the mightiest inventions,
and with all regard for Buddhistic poetry and speculation,
the highest achievements in literature.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems to me that they have made a history of music
singularly well adapted to young minds. They do not
treat their readers as if they were infants—which might
offend them—nor as college professors, which would certainly
bore them. The book will undoubtedly have a
large audience, for teachers of young music students, of
whom there are legions, will surely exclaim: “This is just
what we have needed.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>Babyhood of Music</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c015'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='c016'>Music is Born—How, When and Where</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There was once a time when children did not have to go
to school, for there were no schools; they did not have
to take music lessons because there was no music; there was
not even a language by which people could talk to each other,
and there were no books and no pencils. There were no
churches then, no homes nor cities, no railroads, no roads
in fact, and the oldest and wisest man knew less than a little
child of today.</p>

<p class='c008'>Step by step men fought their way to find means of speaking
to each other, to make roads to travel on, houses to live in,
fire to cook with, clothes to wear, and ways to amuse themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>During this time, over one hundred thousand years ago,
called “prehistoric” because it was before events were recorded,
men had to struggle with things that no longer bother
us.</p>

<p class='c008'>Picture to yourselves this era when people lived out-of-doors,
in mounds and caves surrounded by wild beasts which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>though dangerous, were not much more so than their human
neighbors. Remember, too, that these people did not know
that light followed darkness as the day the night; summer
followed winter as the seasons come and go; that trees lost
their leaves only to bear new ones in the spring, and that
lightning and thunder were natural happenings; and so on
through the long list of things that we think today perfectly
simple, and not in the least frightening.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because they did not understand these natural things,
they thought that trees, sun, rain, animals, birds, fire, birth,
death, marriage, the hunt, caves and everything else had
good and bad gods in them. In order to please these gods
they made prayers to them quite different from our prayers,
as they danced, sang and acted the things they wanted to have
happen. When a savage wanted sun or wind or rain, he called
his tribe together and danced a sun dance, or a wind dance,
or a rain dance. When he wanted food, he did not pray for
it, but he acted out the hunt in a bear dance. As the centuries
went by they continued to use these dances as prayers,
and later they became what we call religious rites and festivals.
So here you see actually the beginning of what we know
as Easter festivals, Christmas with its Christmas tree and
mistletoe, spring festivals and Maypole dances with the
Queen of the May, Hallowe’en and many other holiday celebrations.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is how music, dancing, poetry, painting and drama
were born. They were the means by which primitive men
talked to their gods. This they did, to be sure, very simply,
by hand-clapping and foot-stamping, by swaying their bodies
to and fro, by shouting, shrieking, grunting, crying and
sobbing, and as soon as they knew enough, used language,
and repeated the same word over and over again. These
movements and sounds were the two roots from which music
grew.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you can call these queer grunts and yells singing, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>men of those far-off days must have sung even before they
had a language, in fact, it must have been difficult to know
whether they were singing or talking. In these cries of joy,
sorrow, pain, rage, fear, or revenge, we find another very important
reason for the growth of music. These exclamations,
however barbaric and rough, were man’s first attempt at
expressing his feelings.</p>

<p class='c008'>We still look upon music as one of the most satisfying ways
to show our emotions, and the whole story of music from prehistoric
times to the present day is a record of human feelings
expressed in rhythm and melody.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gradually these early men learned to make not only musical
instruments, but also the knife for hunting and utensils
for cooking. The first step towards a musical instrument
was doubtless the striking together of two pieces of wood or
stone in repeated beats. The next step was the stretching of
the skin of an animal over a hollowed-out stone or tree trunk
forming the first drum. Another simple and very useful instrument
was made of a gourd (the dried hollow rind of a
melon-like fruit) filled with pebbles and shaken like a baby’s
rattle.</p>

<p class='c008'>As early in the story of mankind as this, the love of decoration
and need of beauty were so natural that they decorated
their bodies, the walls of their caves, and their everyday tools
with designs in carving, and in colors made from earth and
plants. You can see some of these utensils and knives, even
bits of wall pictures, in many of the museums in collections
made by men who dig up old cities and sections of the countries
where prehistoric peoples lived. These men are called
archaeologists, and devote their lives to this work so that
we may know what happened before history began.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few years ago tools of flint, utensils made of bone, and
skeletons of huge animals, that no longer exist, were found
in a sulphur spring in Oklahoma; pottery and tools of stone,
wood, and shell were dug up in Arizona; carvings, spear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>heads, arrow points, polished stone hatchets and articles of
stone and ivory in Georgia, Pennsylvania and the Potomac
Valley. This shows that this continent also had been inhabited
by prehistoric people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even as we see prehistoric man using the things of nature
for his tools, such as elephant tusks, flint, and wood; and as
we see him making paint from earth and plants, we also see
him getting music from nature. It would have been impossible
for these early men and children to have lived out-of-doors
and not to have listened to the songs of the birds, the
sound of wind through the trees, the waves against the rocks,
the trickling water of brooks, the beat of the rain, the crashing
of thunder and the cries and roars of animals. All of these
sounds of nature they imitated in their songs and also the
motions and play of animals in their dances.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Kamchatka, the peninsula across the Behring Strait
from Alaska, there still live natives who sing songs named
for and mimicking the cries of their wild ducks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The natives of Australia, which is the home of the amusing-looking
kangaroo, have a dance in which they imitate the
peculiar leaps and motions of this animal. When you recall
its funny long hind legs and short forelegs, you can imagine
how entertaining it would be to imitate its motions. The
natives also try to make the same sounds with their voices, as
the kangaroo. The women accompany these dances by singing
a simple tune of four tones over and over, knocking two
pieces of wood together to keep time. If ever you go to the
Australian bush (woods or forests) you will see this kangaroo
dance. This is different, isn’t it, from sitting in a concert hall
and listening to some great musician who has spent his life in
hard work and study so that he may play or sing for you?</p>

<p class='c008'>We can learn much about the beginnings of music from
tribes of men who, although living today, are very near
the birthday of the world, so far as their knowledge and
habits are concerned.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Primitive men love play; they love to jump, to yell, to
fling their arms and legs about, and to make up stories
which they act out, as children do who “make believe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This love of mankind for make believe, and his desire
to be amused, along with his natural instinct to express
what he feels, are the roots from which music has grown.
But, of course, in prehistoric times, men did not know
that they were making an art, for they were only uttering
in sound and movement their wants, their needs, in fact,
only expressing their daily life and their belief in God.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c016'>The Savage Makes His Music</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Fortunately for our story there live groups of
people today still in the early stages of civilization
who show us the manners and customs of primitive man,
because they are primitive men themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are going to learn how music grew from the American
Indian and the African. We are using these two as examples
for two reasons: because they are close enough to us to
have influenced our own American music, and because all
savage music has similar traits. The American Indian and
the African show us the steps from the primitive state
of music to the beginning of music as an art. In other
words, these people are a bridge between prehistoric music
and that of the civilized world.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Chapter I about prehistoric man, we spoke of the
two roots of music—movement and sound. Hereafter
when we speak of rhythm it will mean movement either
in tones or in gestures. Rhythm expressed in tones makes
music; rhythm expressed in gestures makes the dance.
The reason we like dance music and marches is that we
feel the rhythm, the thing that makes us want to mark
the beat of the music with our feet, or hands, or with head
bobbings. This love of the beat is strong in the savage,
and upon this he builds his music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our American Jazz is the result of our desire for strong
rhythms and shows that we, for all our culture, have something
in us of the savage’s feeling for movement.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>American Indians</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We have a name for everything, but the American
Indian has a name and a song for everything. He has a
song for his moccasins, for his head-gear, for his teepee,
the fire in it, the forest around him, the lakes and rivers in
which he fishes and paddles, for his canoe, for the fish he
catches, for his gods, his friends, his family, his enemies,
the animal he hunts, the maiden he woos, the stars, the
sun, and the moon, in fact for everything imaginable.
The following little story will explain the Indians’ idea of
the use of their songs:</p>

<p class='c008'>An American visitor who was making a collection of
Indian songs, asked an old Ojibway song-leader to sing a
hunting song. The old Indian looked at him in surprise
and left him. A little later the son-in-law of the Indian
appeared and with apologies told the American that “the
old gentleman” could not sing a hunting song because it
was not the hunting season.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next time the old Indian came, the American asked
him for a love song, but he politely refused, saying that
it was not dignified for a man of his age to sing love songs.
However, the old warrior suddenly decided that as he was
making a call, it was quite proper for him to sing Visiting
Songs, which he did, to his host’s delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>This old man had been taught to sing when he was a
very little boy, as the Indian boy learns the history of his
tribe through the songs. He is carefully trained by the
old men and women so that no song of the tribe or family
should be forgotten. These songs are handed down from
one family to another, and no one knows how many hundreds
of years old they may be. So, you see, these songs
become history and the young Indians learn their history
this way, not as we do, from text books.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What new songs did you learn?” is the question that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>one Indian will ask of another who has been away on a
visit, and like the announcer at the radio broadcasting
station, the Indian answers:</p>

<p class='c008'>“My friends, I will now sing you a song of—” and he
fully describes the song. Then he sings it. After he finishes,
he says, “My friends, I have sung you the song
of—” and repeats the name of the song!</p>

<p class='c008'>So great a part of an Indian’s life is music, that he has
no word meaning poetry in his language. Poetry to the
Indian is always song. In fact an Indian puts new words
to an old tune and thinks he has invented a new song.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>What Is Indian Music?</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When the Indian sings, he starts on the highest tone he
can reach and gradually drops to the lowest, so that many
of his songs cover almost two octaves. He does not know
that he sings in a scale of five tones. For some reason
which we cannot explain, most primitive races have used
this same scale. It is like our five black keys on the piano,
starting with F sharp. This is called the pentatonic scale,
(penta, Greek word for five, tonic meaning tones). This
scale is a most amazing traveler, for we meet it in our
musical journeys in China, Japan, Arabia, Scotland,
Africa, Ireland, ancient Peru and Mexico, Greece and many
other places. The reason we find these five tones popular
must be because they are natural for the human throat.
At any rate we know that it is difficult for the Indian to
sing our scale. He does not seem to want the two notes
that we use between the two groups of black keys which
make our familiar major scale.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is very difficult to put down an Indian song in our
musical writing, because, the Indians sing in a natural
scale that has not been changed by centuries of musical
learning. They sing in a rhythm that seems complicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to our ears in spite of all our musical knowledge, and this,
too, is difficult to write down. Another thing which makes
it hard to set down and to imitate Indian music, is that they
beat the drum in different time from the song which they
sing. They seldom strike the drum and sing a tone at the
same time. In fact, the drum and the voice seem to race
with each other. At the beginning of a song, for example,
the drum beat is slower than the voice. Gradually the
drum catches up with the voice and for a few measures
they run along together. The drum gains and wins the
race, because it is played faster than the voice sings. The
curious part of it is, that this is not an accident, but every
time they sing the same song, the race is run the same way.
We are trained to count the beats and sing beat for beat,
measure for measure with the drum. Try to beat on a
drum and sing, and see how hard it is not to keep time
with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Indian slides from tone to tone; he scoops with his
voice, somewhat like the jazz trombone player.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Indian Instruments</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Indian’s orchestra is made up of the rattle and the
drum. The white man cannot understand the Indian’s
love of his drum. However, when he lives among them he
also learns to love it. When Indians travel, they carry
with them a drum which is hidden from the eyes of the
strange white man. When night comes, they have song
contests accompanied by the drum which is taken out of
its hiding place.</p>

<p class='c008'>These contests are very real to the Indians and they are
similar to the tournaments held in Germany in the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drummer, who is also the singer, is called the leading
voice and is so important that he ranks next to the chief.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>His rank is high, because through knowing the songs he is
the historian of his tribe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drum is made of a wooden frame across which is
stretched the skin of an animal, usually a deer. Sometimes
it is only a few inches across, and sometimes it is two feet
in diameter. When it has two surfaces of skins, they are
separated four to six inches from each other. It is held in
the left hand by a leather strap attached to the drum frame,
and beaten with a short stick. (Figure 1.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sioux Indian sets his drum on the ground; it is about
the size of a wash tub and has only one surface. Two or
more players pound this drum at the same time and the
noise is often deafening. The Ojibway drum always has
two surfaces and is usually decorated with gay designs in
color. (Sioux drum, Figure 2.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The drum makes a good weather bureau! The Indian
often forecasts the weather by the way his drum answers
to his pounding. If the sound is dull, he knows there is
rain in the air, if it is clear and sharp and the skin is tight,
he can have out-door dances without fear of a wetting. You
could almost become a weather prophet yourself by watching
the strings of your tennis racket, which act very much
like the drum skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another instrument beloved of all Indians is the rattle.
There are many different sizes and shapes of rattles made
of gourds, horns of animals and tiny drums filled with
pebbles and shot. Some of them are carved out of wood in
the shape of birds and animal heads. (Figure 3.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The Indians also have the flute, and although there is
no special music for it, it is of great importance in their
lives. No two flutes are made to play exactly the same
tones, that is, they are not drawn to scale. They are
like home-whittled whistles made of wood in which holes
are burned. (Figure 4.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The flute is never used in the festivals or in the dance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>but it is the lover’s instrument. A young man who is too
bashful to ask his sweetheart to marry him, hides among
the bushes near her teepee, close to the spring where she
goes every morning for water. When he sees her, he plays
a little tune that he makes up just for her. Being a well
brought up little Indian maid, she pretends not to notice
it, but very soon tries to find out who played to her. If
she likes him, she gives him a sign and he comes out of
his hiding place, but if she does not wish to marry him, she
lets him go on playing every morning until he gets tired
and discouraged and returns no more to the loved spring
near her teepee in the early morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this is the reason the Indian love songs so often refer
to sunrise, spring and fountains, and why we use the melancholy
flute when we write Indian love songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because of the ceaseless beating of the drum, the constant
repetition of their scale of five tones, and the rambling
effect of the music like unpunctuated sentences, we
find the Indian music very monotonous. But they return
the compliment and find our music monotonous, probably,
because it is too well punctuated. Mr. Frederick Burton
in his book on Primitive American Music, tells of having
given to two Indian friends tickets for a recital in Carnegie
Hall, in New York City, where they heard songs by
Schubert and Schumann. When he asked them how they
enjoyed the music they politely said, “It is undoubtedly
very fine, it was a beautiful hall and the man had a great
voice, but it seemed to us as though he sang the song
over, over and over again, only sometimes he made it long
and sometimes short.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Indian Societies</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Indian is a great club man; every Indian belongs to
some society. The society which he joins is decided by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>what he dreams. If he dreams of a bear, he joins the Bear
Society; if he dreams of a Buffalo, he joins the Buffalo
Society. Other names of clubs are: Thunder-bird, Elks and
Wolves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dreams play a great part in the Indian’s life. If he
dreams of a small round stone, a sacred thing to him, he is
supposed to have the power to cure sickness, to foretell
future events, to tell where objects are which cannot be seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every one of the societies or clubs has its own special
songs. The Indians also have songs of games, dances,
songs of war and of the hunt, songs celebrating the deeds
of chiefs, conquering warriors, war-path and council songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first chapter we spoke of primitive man imitating
animals and here we find that the Indians, in their societies
named for animals, imitate the acts of the clubs’
namesakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>They have a dance called the grass dance, in which they
decorate their belts with long tufts of grass, a reminder of
the days when they wore scalps on their belts after they
had been on the “war-path.” In this dance they imitate
the motions of the eagle and other birds. Even the
feathers used in their head-dress is a part of their custom of
imitating animals and birds. Some of these head-dresses
are like the comb, and the Indian who wears this will imitate
the cries of the bird to which the comb belongs. His
actions always correspond with his costume.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Indians have lullabies and children’s game-songs,—the
moccasin game, in which they search for sticks hidden
in a moccasin. Then too, there is the Rain Dance of the
Junis and the Snake Dance of the Hopis, in which they
carry rattlesnakes, sometimes holding them between the
teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dance often means a ceremony lasting several days.
The Indians are worshippers of the Sun, and have a festival,
which lasts several days, called the Sun Dance. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>festival took place particularly among the Indians of the
plains: the Cheyennes, the Chippewas and others. The
last Sun Dance took place in 1882. In this the Indian
offered to the “Great Spirit” what was strongest in his
nature and training,—the ability to stand pain. Self
inflicted pain was a part of the ceremony and seemed
noble to the Indian, but to the white man it was barbarous
and heathenish and he put a stop to it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Medicine Man</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Have you ever heard of the medicine man? He is doctor,
lawyer, priest, philosopher, botanist, and musician all in
one. The society of “Grand Medicine” is the religion of
the Chippewas. It teaches that one must be good to live
long. The chief aims of the society are to bring good
health and long life to its followers, and music is as important
in the healing as medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every member of the society carries a bag of herbs, the
use of which he has learned, and if called upon to heal the
sick, he works the cure by singing the right song before giving
the medicine. The medicine is not usually swallowed in
proper fashion as a child takes a dose, but it is carried by
the sick person, or is placed among his belongings, or a
little wooden figure is carved roughly by the Medicine
Man and must be carried around with the herbs to heal
the patient. But the song, and it must be the right song
for the occasion, counts as much as the medicine. Wouldn’t
you like to be an Indian?</p>

<p class='c008'>Often the Medicine Man is called upon for a love-charm,
for which there is a song. There are also songs of cursing
which are supposed to work an evil charm when used with
a certain kind of cursing herbs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both men and women may become members of the
Great Medicine Society, and they must go through eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>degrees or stages in which they are taught the use of the
medicines and the songs. Each member of the society
has his own set of songs, some of which he has composed
himself and others he has had to buy for large sums of
money or goods. No man is allowed to sing another man’s
song unless he has bought the right to it. With the sale of
a song goes the herb to be used with that particular song.
The ceremony is very elaborate. It lasts for several days,
and sounds very much like a story book.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Chippewa Indians have had a written picture language
by means of which they read the different songs.
These pictures were usually drawn on white birch-bark.
Here are a few samples:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>When we tell you about American music we will speak
again of the Indian and how we have used in our own music
what he has given us.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Negro and His Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The place of the negro in the world of music has been
the cause of many questions:</p>

<p class='c008'>Is his music that of a primitive man?</p>

<p class='c008'>Is it American?</p>

<p class='c008'>Is it American Folk Music?</p>

<p class='c008'>As we tell you the story of music we shall have to speak
of the negro music from all these different sides. But, for
you to understand why there is a question about it, we
must tell you where the negro came from and what he
brought from his primitive home.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the English first came to Virginia and founded
Jamestown in 1607 they started to grow tobacco on great
plantations, and for this they needed cheap labor. They
tried to use Indians, but as the work killed so many of
them, they had negroes sent over from Africa to do it. A
year before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620,
negroes were already being sold as slaves in Virginia.
Until 1808 these negroes were brought over from Africa;
they were not all of one tribe, nor were they of one race.
There were Malays from Madagascar, Movis from northern
Africa, red skins and yellow skins as well as black.</p>

<p class='c008'>These people were primitive and they all used song
and dance in their religion, their work and their games.
They brought from Africa a great love for music and ears
that heard and remembered more than many a trained
musician. A well-known writer has said that wherever
the African negro has gone, he has left traces in the music
of that country. The Spanish Habanera, which we have
danced by the name of Tango came from Africa; even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>name is African, “tangara,” and was a vulgar dance unfit
for civilized people. The rhythm of the African dance and
of our tango is the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like other savages, the African negro loved rhythm better
than melody. His songs were monotonous and were made
up of a few tones and short repeated phrases. They used
the scale, of five tones (called pentatonic), the same as the
Indian’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>The African negro was a master at drumming. The
Indian drumming was regular like the clock or pulse, but
the negro played most difficult and complicated rhythms,
almost impossible for a trained musician, to imitate. He
had drums of all sizes and kinds.</p>

<p class='c008'>These savages sang groups of tones which we call chords,
which were not used by any of the ancient civilized people.
By means of different rhythms they had hundreds of ways
of combining the three tones of a chord as C-E-G. It is
curious that these primitive people should have used methods
more like our own than many of the races that had
reached a much higher degree of civilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Africans had an original telegraph system in which
they did not use the Morse code, but sent their messages
by means of drums that were heard many miles away.
They had a special drum language which the natives understood;
and the American Indians flashed <em>their</em> messages
over long distances by means of the reflection of the sun
on metal.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is only a little more than a hundred years ago since
we stopped bringing these primitive people into America
and making slaves of them. Their children have become
thoroughly Americanized now, from having lived alongside
of the white people all this time and some have forgotten
their African forefathers. But in the same way that the
children of Italian, German, French or Russian parents
remember the songs of their forefathers and often show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>traces of these songs in the music they make, so the negro
without knowing it has kept some of the primitive traits of
African music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, we will tell you how this grew into two kinds of
music, the beautiful religious song called the Negro Spiritual,
and the dance which has grown into our popular ragtime
and jazz.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we were to study in detail the music of many savage
tribes of different periods from prehistoric day to the uncivilized
people living today, we should find certain points in
common. They all have festival songs, songs for religious
ceremonials, for games, work songs, war songs, hunting
songs and love songs. In fact it is a beautiful habit for
primitive people to put into song everything they do and
everything they wish to remember. With them music has
not been a frill or a luxury, but a daily need and a natural
means for expressing themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another thing alike among these early peoples, is that
all of them had drums and rattles of some kind and a
roughly made instrument that resembles our pipes. But
they had no stringed instruments and for their beginnings
you will have to journey on with us in this,—your book.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since giving this book to the public, we have come in
direct contact with some remarkable songs of the Nootka
(Canadian) Indians and of the Eskimos. Juliette Gaultier
de la Verendry, a young French Canadian, has sung them
in New York in the original dialect. They have been given
to her by D. Jenness, an anthropologist who lived among
the Eskimos for several years, studying their traits and at
the same time he took the opportunity of writing down their
songs. They are truly savage music and have the characteristics
of which we have spoken in the use of intervals,
drums, and in the type of songs, such as weather and healing
incantations (medicine songs), work songs, and dances.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='c016'>The Ancient Nations Made Their Music—Egyptian, Assyrian, and Hebrew</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Three thousand years before Jesus was born, a corner
of southwestern Asia and northeastern Africa was
the home of people who had reached a very high degree of
civilization. They were the first to pass the stage of primitive
man, and to make for themselves beautiful buildings,
beautiful cities, monuments, decorations and music.
Among these ancient, civilized people were the Egyptians,
the Assyrians and the Hebrews. We will talk first about
the Egyptians because they had the greatest influence
not only on the Assyrian and Hebrew music, but also on
the Greeks who went to Egypt. So, in European music
we can trace the Egyptian influence through the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Egyptians were very fond of building and they
decorated what they built with pictures in vivid colorings
called hieroglyphics (heiro—sacred, glyphics—writings).
As they had neither newspapers nor radio sets, they carved
or painted the records of their daily lives, their festivals,
battles, entertainments, and even marketing journeys on
the walls and on the columns of the temples, on the obelisks,
and in the tombs, some of which were the pyramids.</p>

<p class='c008'>The climate saved these records from destruction, and
the archaeologists re-discovered them for us in the tombs
full of Egyptian treasure and the temples and lost cities,
buried for thousands of years.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The Egyptians built to inspire feelings of awe, mystery
and grandeur. You probably remember pictures of obelisks,
temples, pyramids, tombs and sphinxes, alongside
of which a man looks but a few inches high.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were very young as the world goes, and built huge
structures because they were still filled with wonder at the
immensity and power of the things they saw in Nature,—the
Nile; the great desert which seemed vaster to them
because they had only slow-moving camels, elephants and
horses to take them about; they saw very long rainy seasons
and the Nile overflowing its banks yearly, long dry
seasons and the terrible wind and sand storms; the great
heat of the sun, and the glory of their huge flowers, such
as the lotus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as primitive people did, they personified Nature in
the gods. They had Osiris—god of Light, Health and
Agriculture; Isis—goddess of the Arts and Agriculture;
Horus (hawk-headed), the Sun god; Phtah, first divine
King of Memphis, and many others. Again like primitive
people, they had music for their gods, for their temple
services, for their state ceremonies, festivals, martial celebrations
and amusements.</p>

<p class='c008'>Primitive music, we saw, had no laws to bind it, but was
guided by the savage’s natural feeling and he could make
up anything he wished. In Egypt, because of state law
which prevented it from changing, music was held down
to the same system for three thousand years. New music
was forbidden, and much of the old was considered sacred
and so closely connected with religious ceremonies that
it was allowed to be used only in the temples.</p>

<p class='c008'>The priests lived in these magnificent temples and
were the philosophers, artists and musicians, very like
the medicine men of the Indians, but much more advanced
in learning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like the American Indians, too, the profession of music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>was handed down from father to son, and only the children
of singers, whether they had good voices or not, could sing
in the temples.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the monuments we see these singers followed by
players of instruments. The singers were of the highest
caste, or Priest caste; the players were usually of the lower
classes, or the Slave caste, although as pictured on the
tombs of Rameses, one of Egypt’s greatest rulers and
builders, we see the priests dressed in splendid robes and
playing large harps.</p>

<p class='c008'>The temples of Egypt were so huge that the music had
to be on a large scale. They thought nothing of an orchestra
of six hundred players of harps, lyres, lutes, flutes and
sistrums (bell rattles), whereas we today advertise in large
type the fact of one hundred men in one orchestra! We
see no trumpets in the picture writings of the Egyptian
orchestra, for these were only used in war, and we find
them only in their pictures of war and triumphal marches;
nor do we see large drums, because the Egyptians clapped
their hands to mark rhythm. However, the military instruments
in the hands of players pictured on the monuments,
show that they used trumpets and tambourines in
the army.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the names we find in the tombs—“Singers of the
King” and “Singers of the Master of the World,” we
know that the Kings had musicians of high rank in their
courts. The paintings on the walls and columns of the
ruins of the temple Karnak, show funeral services with
kneeling singers, playing harps of seven strings and other
instruments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ptolemy Soter II, another famous Egyptian ruler, gave
a fête in which were heard a chorus of twelve hundred
voices, accompanied by three hundred Greek <em>kitharas</em> and
many flutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems like a fairy tale that we can bring back the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>manners and customs of three thousand years ago through
studying the writings in stone called hieroglyphics, and by
examining the things used every day, that were found in
the excavations. For a long time the hieroglyphics were
unsolved riddles until the discovery in 1799 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> of the
Rosetta stone, on which was an inscription in hieroglyphics
with its Greek translation. Although ancient Greek is
called a dead language, it still has enough life in it to bring
back the history and records of antiquity. Through this
knowledge of Greek, the Egyptian inscriptions speak to us
and tell us marvelous stories of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p class='c008'>In one of the tombs at Thebes, was a harp with strings
of catgut, which when plucked, still gave out sounds
although the harp had probably not been played upon in
three thousand years!</p>

<p class='c008'>Going once more to our ancient stone library—or collections
of monuments in our museums or in Egypt—we
see many pictures of dancers. The Egyptians danced in
religious ceremonies as well as in private entertainments.
They loved lively dances, and the men did all sorts of
acrobatic steps and even toe-dancing like our Pavlowa,
while the women did the slow, languorous dances.</p>

<p class='c008'>Egyptian music was greatest as far back as 3000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>!
After that it grew poorer until 525 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> when Egypt was
conquered by Persia.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Egyptian Scale</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Egyptians must have used a musical scale of whole
steps and half steps, covering several octaves, not unlike
ours. Think of the piano keyboard with its black and its
white keys and you will get an idea of the Egyptian scale.
We learned this through the discovery of a flute that played
a scale of half steps from <em>a</em> below middle <em>c</em> to <em>d</em> above the
staff with only a few tones missing.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Assyrian Music</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In the British Museum in London and in the Louvre in
Paris, you can see ancient records which archaeologists
unearthed from three mounds near the River Tigris in
Asiatic Turkey. These mounds were the remains of the
Assyrian cities of Nimroud (Babylon), Khorsabad, and probably
the famous Nineveh, and date from 3000 to 1300 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>Did Assyria influence Egypt or was it the other way
around? The Egyptians excelled in making mechanical
things such as instruments, utensils, tools, and in building
temples and pyramids; while the Assyrians were sculptors,
workers in metals and enamel, and knew the secret of dyeing
and weaving stuffs, and of making beautiful pottery.
But whose music was the better, the Egyptians or the Assyrians,
is impossible to say. We do know, however, that the
Assyrians, as well as the Egyptians and Hebrews, had perfected
music far beyond the standard reached by many
nations of our own time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Assyrians had the same families of instruments
that we have,—the percussion (or drums), wind, and
strings; and they used different combinations of instruments
in concerts, either in instrumental performances or
for accompanying vocal music. Everything that we know
about them shows that the Assyrians were greater noisemakers
than the Egyptians, for they not only had drums
and trumpets, but they also marked rhythm by stamping
their feet instead of clapping their hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The instruments pictured on the monuments, probably
existed many centuries before the building of these monuments,
which would make them very old indeed. In fact,
almost all of them are still in use in the Orient today and
are played in the same way. The monuments also prove
that some of the special ceremonies in which music was
used are still in existence.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Both the Assyrians and the Egyptians had flutes, and
double flutes which were actually two flutes connected by
one mouthpiece and looked like the letter v. The Assyrians
also had harps that varied in size from some that could
be carried in the hand, to some that stood seven feet high
and had as many as twenty-two strings. The dulcimer, an
instrument something like a zither, was very popular and
was made so that it could be played standing upright or
lying flat. They also had drums, castanets, cymbals,
tambours or tambourines, and lyres, all of which could be
easily carried.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Assyrians being a warlike nation made their instruments
so that they could be strapped to their bodies.
So it seems that people in 3000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> were practical.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Assyrians were so fond of music that when their
war-prisoners were musicians they were not put to death.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hebrew Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We get our knowledge of the Hebrew music not from
stone monuments and wall pictures, but from Biblical
writings and other ancient Hebrew records. In the Second
Commandment, God forbids the Hebrews to make images:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image,
nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or in
the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth.”
(Exodus XXI: 4.) With so strict a commandment, you
can understand why there are no pictures of singers and
of instruments, and that we have to go to the greatest
literary gift to the world,—the Old Testament, to find out
about their music.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first musician mentioned in the Bible is Jubal.
It says in Genesis IV: 21, “he was the father of all such as
handle the harp and pipe (or organ).” From an old Spanish
book found in the early 18th century in a Mexican
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>monastery, comes the story that Jubal was listening to
Tubal-Cain’s forge, and noticed the difference in pitch of
the sounds made by the strokes on the anvil. Some tones
were high, some low, and some were medium. He compared
this to the human voice, and tried to imitate the
sounds, high, low and medium, of the forge. Thus he
became the first singer of the Hebrews. Jubal invented a
flute and a little three-cornered harp called the <em>kinnor</em>.
These small instruments were most convenient to carry
about, for at this time the Hebrews were shepherd tribes
wandering from place to place. Their music was simple as
is the music of all primitive peoples.</p>

<p class='c008'>We know from the Biblical story that the Children of
Israel were sold into captivity and remained many centuries
in Egypt; that Moses was found in the bulrushes by
Pharoah’s daughter, and was educated as an Egyptian boy
and “was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.”
Therefore, he must have learned music from the priests.
It is natural then, that the Hebrews must have borrowed
the music and instruments of their adopted country in the
making of their own.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Moses had been commanded by the Lord to lead
the children of Israel out of the land of captivity, and after
the Red Sea had divided to allow them to pass through, we
read the great song of triumph sung by Moses:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then sang Moses and the Children of Israel: ‘I will
sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously, the
horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea, Jehovah is
my strength and my song and he is become my salvation.’”
etc.—(Exodus XV: 1–2).</p>

<p class='c008'>And “Miriam, the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took
a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her
with timbrels and with dances.” (The timbrel is a small
tambourine-like instrument.)</p>

<p class='c008'>This story, like others in the Old Testament, is full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the accounts of musical instruments, singing and dancing,
and shows us that the ancient Hebrews used music and the
dance for nearly every event. If you read carefully you
will get the musical history of this poetic people.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the Children of Israel were in the wilderness,
Moses received from Jehovah the command: (Numbers X.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece
shalt thou make them; that thou mayest use them for the
calling of the assembly, and for the journeyings of the
camp.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then follow directions as to the meaning of the blowing
of the trumpets. One trumpet alone called the princes;
two trumpets called the entire tribe together; an “alarm”
gave the signal for the camps to go forward, and so on. So,
you see the ancient Hebrews used trumpets much as we
today use the army bugle. The trumpets mentioned as
one of the earliest of all instruments called the people to
religious ceremonies too; it announced festivals, the declaration
of a war, the crowning of a king, proclaimed the jubilee
year, and gave warning of the anger of God.</p>

<p class='c008'>One instrument has come down to our times and is still
used in the Hebrew temple services. This is called the
<em>shofar</em> and is usually a ram’s horn on which two tones may
be blown. Probably, as the ram was one of the animals of
sacrifice, they used its horn as a sacred instrument. This
shofar is 5,000 years old, at least. It is sounded in all the
synagogues of the world on the Jewish New Year and on the
Day of Atonement in memory of the wanderings of the
Children of Israel.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the twelve tribes, after their wanderings in the
wilderness, had settled down in Palestine, they gave music a
most important place in their daily life. Samuel, the last
and most respected of the judges, built a school of prophecy
and music. Here it was that young David hid himself to
escape the persecutions of Saul. You remember that David
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>is called the Great Musician and he gave us many of the
Psalms, the most beautiful religious verse in the world.
How much it would mean to us if we knew the music David
sang to these songs! In spite of the fact that the music in
which they were originally sung has been lost, the Psalms
have been an inspiration to all composers of religious music
throughout the ages. David learned so much at Samuel’s
school that he created a most beautiful musical service for
the temple, which is the basis of the one used today in
Jewish synagogues (temples).</p>

<p class='c008'>The number that were instructed in the songs of the
Lord was two hundred, four score and eight (288). There
were in all four thousand, including assistants, students,
players of instruments and the two hundred and eighty-eight
professional singers.</p>

<p class='c008'>All of these people did not perform at one time; for the
ordinary services they used twelve male singers, twelve
players on instruments,—nine harps, and two players of
the psaltery and one of cymbals. Women were not allowed
to sing in the temples but they were a part of the court and
sang at funerals and at public festivities and banquets.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great Jewish historian, Josephus, tells us that Solomon
had two hundred thousand singers, forty thousand
harpists, forty thousand sistrum players and two hundred
thousand trumpeters. This is hard to believe, but as
everything belonged to the kings in bygone days, probably
this was only Solomon’s musical directory.</p>

<p class='c008'>The psaltery was an instrument something like our zither,
with thirteen strings on a flat wooden sounding board, rectangular
in shape. The sistrum was a metal rattle which
made a very sweet sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>It isn’t easy to describe the instruments used thousands
of years ago, for the names have become changed through
the ages, and we find the same type of instruments called
by different names in different countries and periods. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>example, the psaltery is much the same instrument as the
<em>dulcimer</em>, the Arab’s <em>kanoun</em> and the Persian <em>santir</em>. We
find the same psaltery in Chaucer’s “Miller’s Tale” as
<em>sautrie</em>. By the addition of a keyboard this Biblical instrument
became the <em>spinet</em>, which you will meet again in
the 15th and 16th centuries. In the 13th century, in Italy,
we find a kind of psaltery hung around the neck and
called “Istroménto di porco” because it looked like the head
of a pig.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not all the songs of the Bible are religious. The Song
of Solomon, a most beautiful poem of marriage, gives us a
vivid picture of luxury and magnificence, as well as showing
us that music was used for other than religious ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the death of Solomon, the music in the temple lost
its splendor and again the Children of Israel were made
captive. When one hundred years later Nebuchadnezzar
(586 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) the King of Babylon, destroyed their temple, the
song of the Hebrews became sad and mournful, as you can
read in the Book of Lamentations and in this beautiful song
of grief, the 137th Psalm:</p>

<p class='c008'>During the next few centuries the Hebrews became
scattered over the world, carrying with them their reverence
for God, their love of poetry and song, and their religious
customs. These qualities have persisted throughout
the centuries, and some of the greatest musicians in the
world have been of Hebrew origin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although most of the old music has passed away, there
is still enough of its spirit left in their temple services to
give some idea of the ancient Hebrew music.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='c016'>The Greeks Lived Their Music—The Romans Used Greek Patterns</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The Greeks “dwelt with beauty” and believed it to be
a part of being good, and they strove to make everything
beautiful. Beauty to the Greeks was a religion. Had
this not been so, we would not have the Venus de Milo, the
Parthenon in Athens, the Hermes, the Winged Victory
(Niké of Samothrace) and all the other Greek masterpieces
which no modern sculptor or builder has surpassed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is interesting to see a nation 400 years before the time
of Christ and even earlier, making glorious art works in
stone, and writing the greatest plays the world has ever
had, being more grown up than modern nations, and yet as
far as we know an infant in the art of music. We have only
the slightest idea of how their music sounded as they had
no accurate way of writing it, and had only very primitive
instruments. Although when compared to their other
arts their music was not great, still it was very important
to them and they used it constantly with poetry, dancing,
and in the drama.</p>

<p class='c008'>The word music was first used by the Greeks and has
been carried into nearly every language; we find <em>musique</em>
in French, <em>Musik</em> in German, <i><span lang="it">musica</span></i> in Italian, and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Music, according to the Greeks, was an art which combined
not only the playing of instruments, singing and
dancing, but also all the arts and sciences, including mathematics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and everything in the universe. It took its name
from the Muses, and they believed that it led to the beautiful
accord and harmony of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nine Muses were daughters of Jupiter, and each
presided over some particular department of literature, art
and science.</p>

<p class='c008'>Clio: Muse of History and Epic Poetry. She is shown
in statues and pictures holding a half open scroll.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thalia: Muse of Joy and Comedy (drama) with a comic
mask in one hand and a crooked staff in the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Erato: Muse of Lyric Poetry, inspired those who wrote of
love. She plays on a nine-stringed lyre.</p>

<p class='c008'>Euterpe: Muse of Lyric Song, patroness of music especially
of flute players. She holds two flutes (<em>auloi</em>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Polyhymnia: Muse of Sacred Song. She holds her forefinger
to her lips or carries a scroll.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calliope: Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry, holds a
roll of parchment, or a trumpet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Terpsichore: Muse of the Dance, presiding over choral,
dance and song. She appears dancing with a seven-stringed
lyre.</p>

<p class='c008'>Urania: Muse of Astronomy, holds the globe and traces
mathematical figures with a wand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Melpomene: Muse of Tragedy (drama), leans on a club
and holds a tragic mask.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Myths and Legends</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The myths and legends of the ancient Greeks read like
fairy tales, but to the Greeks they were what our Bible
stories are to us. In their rich mythology we find many
stories about the beginnings of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Pan, the god of woods and fields, of flocks and shepherds,
is given the credit of inventing the shepherd’s pipe,
or Pan’s Pipes. He lived in grottoes, wandered on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>mountains and in the valleys, and amused himself hunting,
leading the dances of the nymphs, and playing on his pipes.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pan’s Pipes</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A beautiful nymph named Syrinx was loved by Pan, but
every time that he tried to tell her of his love, she became
frightened and ran away, for Pan was a funny looking lover
with goat’s legs, a man’s body, and long pointed ears. One
day he chased her through the woods to the bank of a river;
she called out in fright, and was suddenly changed by her
friends the Water Nymphs, into a clump of tall reeds.
When he reached out to embrace her, instead of Syrinx, he
had the clump of reeds in his arms! As he sighed in disappointment,
his breath passing through the reeds, produced
a sad wail. Pan, hearing in it a plaintive song, broke off
the reeds in unequal lengths, bound them together, and
made the first musical instrument, which he called a syrinx
in memory of his lost sweetheart. These pipes comforted
Pan, and he played many tender melodies, and often without
being seen, was known to be near by his lovely music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pan, although adored, was feared. At one time, Brennus,
a warrior, with a company of Gauls (a tribe from ancient
France), attacked the Temple of Delphi (in Greece), and
was about to destroy it, when suddenly they turned and
fled in fear although no one pursued them. Their terror
was supposed to have been of Pan’s making, and to this day
we use the word “panic” (Pan-ic) for all sudden overpowering
fright.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Apollo</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Pan is supposed to have taught music to Apollo, the god
of Music and of the Sun. You have seen statues of him
with a lyre in his hands. As Pan’s pupil he learned to play
the syrinx so beautifully that he won a prize in a contest
with Marsyas, a mortal who played the flute invented (according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to the Greek legend), by Pallas Athene. This
goddess was sometimes known as Musica or Musician.
When Cupid saw her play the flute he laughed at her because
she made such queer faces. This angered her, and
she flung her flute away. It fell down from Mt. Olympus
to the earth, and Marsyas picked it up and became such a
skilful player that he challenged the god Apollo to a contest
for flute championship of the world! The day came
and Apollo won the prize, but put Marsyas to death for
daring to challenge him—a god. Apollo afterwards was
very sorry and broke all the strings of his lyre and placed it
with his flutes in a haunt of Dionysus (god of Wine), to
whom he consecrated these instruments.</p>

<p class='c008'>These stories are not only a part of the ancient Greek
religion but they have become, on account of their beauty,
a rich source of plot and story for the works of musicians,
artists and writers from the days of antiquity to our own
time.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Orpheus</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the favorite Greek stories has been that of Orpheus,
who went down to Hades to bring his dead wife whom he
adored, back to earth, and about whom Peri, Gluck, and
others wrote operas. He was son of Apollo and of Calliope,
the Muse of Epic Poetry, and became such a fine performer
on all instruments, that he charmed all things animate and
inanimate. He tamed wild birds and beasts, and even the
trees and rocks followed him as he played, the winds and
the waves obeyed him, and he soothed and made the
Dragon, who guarded the Golden Fleece, gentle and harmless.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the cruise of the <cite>Argo</cite> in search of the Golden Fleece,
Orpheus not only succeeded in launching the boat when the
strength of the heroes had failed in the task, but when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>were passing the islands of the Sirens, he sang so loudly and
so sweetly that the Sirens’ songs could not be heard and the
crew were saved.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Music in Their Daily Life</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When a people have legends about music you may know
that they love it. Such was the case with the Greeks.
They did not call their schools high schools and colleges but
Music schools, and everything that we call learning they
included under the name of music. Every morning the
little Greek boy was sent to the Music school where he was
taught the things that were considered necessary for a citizen
to know. Here he learned gymnastics, poetry, and
music. At home too, music was quite as important as in
school, and we know that they had folk songs which had to
do with the deeds of ordinary life, such as farming and winemaking
and grape-picking, and the effect and beauty of the
seasons of the year. (See Chap. IX.) They can well be
divided into songs of joy and songs of sorrow, and seem to
have existed even before Homer the Blind Bard. If you
ever have tried to dance or do your daily dozen without
music, you will understand at once how much help music
always has been to people as they worked.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Harvest Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>All harvest songs in Greece had the name of Lytiersis.
Lytiersis was the son of King Midas, known as the richest
king in the world. Lytiersis was a king himself but also a
mighty reaper, and according to Countess Martinengo-Cesaresco
who has written a book called <cite>Essays in the Study
of Folk-Songs</cite> it was his “habit to indulge in trials of strength
with his companions and with strangers who were passing
by. He tied the vanquished up in sheaves and beat them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>One day he defied an unknown stranger, who proved too
strong for him and by whom he was slain.” The first
harvest song was composed to console King Midas for the
death of his son. We can make a fable from this story
which means that Nature and Man are always struggling
against each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>The harvest festivals founded in Greece led to others in
Brittany, France, North Germany and England. So does
the deed of one race affect other races.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Liturgies</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Among the taxes, or five special liturgies, that the Greeks
had to pay, was the obligation for certain rich citizens to
supply the Greek tragedies with the chorus. Every Greek
play had its chorus and every chorus had to have its structures;
a choregic monument to celebrate it; one or more
flute players, costumes, crowns, decorations, teachers for
the chorus and everything else to make it succeed.
This cost, which would equal many thousands of dollars,
was undertaken as a duty quite as easily as our men of
wealth pay their income taxes. You can see a greatly
enlarged copy of a choregic monument, the Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ monument at 89th Street and Riverside Drive, in
New York City, and also one at the Metropolitan Museum.</p>

<p class='c008'>In old Greece the musicians were also poets. Homer,
Hesiod, Pindar, Æschylus, Sophocles, Sappho, Euripides,
Plato, not only wrote their dramas but knew what music
should be played with them. In fact no play was complete
without its chorus and its music and its flute-player. You
have heard of the Greek chorus. Don’t for a moment think
it was like our chorus. It consisted of a group of masked
actors (all actors in those days wore masks), who appeared
between the acts and intoned (chanted) the meaning of the
play and subsequent events. In fact the chorus took the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>place of a libretto,—“words and music of the opera,” for
it explained to the audience what it should expect. It spoke
and sang some of the most important lines of the play and
danced in appropriate rhythms. So it brought together
word, action and music, and was a remote ancestor of
opera, oratorio and ballet.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Festivals</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Besides the occupational songs and those for the drama
festivals, the Greeks had the great game festivals where
in some, not only competitions in sports took place but also
flute playing and singing. The oldest of these festivals was
the Olympic games, first held in 776 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> and every four
years thereafter. These games played so important a part
in the lives of the Greeks that their calendar was divided
into Olympiads instead of years. While music was evident
in the Olympic games, music and poetry were never among
the competitions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Pythian games were chiefly musical and poetic contests
and were started in Delphi, 586 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, where they were
held every nine years in honor of the Delphian Apollo whose
shrine was at Delphi. The Isthmian and Nemean games
were also based on poetic and musical contests. Warriors,
statesmen, philosophers, artists and writers went to these
games and took part in them. Maybe some time we will
realize the power of music as did the Greeks nearly one
thousand years before the birth of Jesus.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Greek Scales</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>While, as we said before, we know very little about the
melodies of the Greeks, we do know something about their
scales, upon which the church music of the Middle Ages
was based, as are our own major and minor scales. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>fact the most important contribution Greece made to our
music was the scale. They had a very complicated system
and no one is quite sure how it worked.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have the two modes or kinds of scales, major and
minor, which we use in different keys, but the Greeks had
at least seven different modes used in many different ways.
They used one mode for martial or military music, another
for funeral ceremonies, another for their temple music, and
curiously enough, our own C major scale they used for
their popular music, for drinking songs, and light festivities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Greek scales were based on <em>tetrachords</em>, from the
Greek words tetra-four, chord-string that is, a group of
four strings. If you play on the piano B C D E and
C D E F and D E F G you will find the three tetrachords
that formed the <em>primary modes</em> of the Greeks:—Dorian,
Phrygian and Lydian.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps you have heard in Greek architecture of the
Doric column which came from Doria, a province in Greece,
and the Ionic column, from Ionia, and so on. In the same
way the scales were named for sections of the country from
which they first came, Dorian mode, Ionian, Æolian,
Phrygian, Lydian, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Greek tetrachord was formed on the interval of a
fourth, for example from E to A—these were called <em>standing
tones</em>, because the intervals between the two standing tones
or permanent tones could be changed but the first and the
fourth always remained the same—</p>

<div id='i_038'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_038.jpg' alt='"E' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>By putting two tetrachords together all the other Greek
scales were formed. These fell into two classes, and according
to Cecil Forsyth in his <cite>History of Music</cite> these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>classes were called the <em>join</em> and the <em>break</em>. When the second
tetrachord began on the fourth tone of the first tetrachord,
Mr. Forsyth calls it the <em>joining</em> method, thus.</p>

<div id='i_039a'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_039a.jpg' alt='⎴E͡FGA⎴——⎴A͡B♭CD⎴' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When the second tetrachord began on the tone above the
fourth tone of the first tetrachord, he calls it the <em>breaking</em>
method, thus:</p>

<div id='i_039b'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_039b.jpg' alt='⎴E͡FGA⎴ ⎴B͡CDE⎴' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>By using the <em>join</em> and the <em>break</em> with each of the three modes,
Dorian, Phrygian and Lydian, you can see to what a great
variety of scales and names this would lead. The Greeks
spoke of their scales from the top note down, instead of from
the lowest note up, as we do.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first <em>kithara</em> was supposed to have been an instrument
of four strings that could be tuned in any of these different
ways, with the half-step either between the first and second
strings, or between the second and third, or between the
third and fourth. Two instruments tuned differently
formed the complete scale, but it did not take long to add
strings to their lyres and kitharas so that they could play
an entire scale on one instrument.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little Greek boy was taught in school to tune the
scale according to the fourth string of his lyre, which was
the <em>home tone</em> or what we should call <em>tonic</em>. Our tonic falls
on the first degree of the scale, but in the <em>primary modes</em> of
the Greeks, the tonic fell on the fourth degree, and was
called the <em>final</em>. When the final was on pitch all the other
strings had to be tuned to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>These tetrachords are supposed to have been perfected by
Terpander, in the six hundreds before Christ. His melodies
were called <em>nomes</em> and were supposed to have had a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>moral effect on the Spartan youth in giving him spirit and
courage. The Greeks thought that all music and that every
one of their modes had a special effect on conduct and character.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the Messenian war, Sparta was in such a state of
upheaval that the Delphian oracle was consulted. The
answer was:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When Terpander’s Cithar shall sound</div>
      <div class='line'>Contention in Sparta shall cease.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So the Spartans called upon Terpander to help them, and
through the power of his song all was peace again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Terpander collected Asiatic, Egyptian, Æolian and
Bœotian melodies all of which are unfortunately lost; he
invented a new notation and enlarged the kithara from four
strings to seven. Arion, Alcæus and the great poetess
Sappho were his pupils, and Sappho is often shown in
statues with a six stringed kithara.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of these poet singers were called “lyric poets”
because they sang to the accompaniment of the lyre.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pythagoras</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Greeks were the first to write down their music, or
to make a musical notation whereby the singers and players
knew what tones to use. Their system was their alphabet
with certain alterations. They had names describing each
tone not unlike our use of the word <em>tonic</em> for the first degree
of the scale, and <em>dominant</em> for the fifth and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course they did not have the <em>staff</em> and <em>treble</em> and <em>bass
clefs</em> as we have, but they were groping for some way of
recording music in those far away days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pythagoras as far back as 584–504 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, not only influenced
the music in the classical Greek period (400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>but down to and throughout the Middle Ages to the Renaissance
(1500s). To this day music is based on his mathematical
discovery. He worked out a theory of numbers
based on the idea that all nature was governed by the law
of numbers and modern scientists have proven that he was
correct in many of his ideas. In fact our orchestras and
pianos are tuned in accordance with his theories.</p>

<p class='c008'>He invented an instrument called the monochord which
consisted of a hollow wooden box with one string and movable
fret. He discovered that when he divided the string
exactly in half by means of the fret, the tone produced was
an octave higher than the tone given out by striking the
entire string; one-third of the string produced the interval
of a fifth above the octave; one-fourth the length of the
string produced a fourth above the fifth; one-fifth produced
a third (large or major) above the fourth; one-sixth produced
a third (small or minor); one-seventh produced a
slightly smaller third and one-eighth produced a large
second, three octaves above the sound of the entire string:</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The truth of Pythagoras’ theory of tone relationship has
been proven by an experiment in physics showing that all
of the above tones belong to the same tone family. An
amusing experiment can be made by pressing silently any
one of the tones marked 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8, and striking the
fundamental tone sharply, the key you are pressing silently
will sound so that you can distinctly hear its pitch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Greeks seem to have had no harmony (that is, combining
of two or more tones in chords) outside of the natural
result of men’s voices and women’s singing together. But
they had groups of singers answering each other in what
is called <em>antiphony</em> (anti-against, phony-sound). Even our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>American Indians have their song leader and chorus answering
each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Greek rhythm followed the rhythm of the spoken word
and was considered a part of their poetic system.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Greek Instruments</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We have already spoken of the <em>syrinx</em>, Pan’s Pipes, the
instrument of Pan, the satyrs and of the shepherds; the
<em>monochord</em>, Pythagoras’ invention; the <em>lyre</em> and <em>kithara</em>; and
the flute or <em>aulos</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lyre, of the family of stringed instruments, was the
Greek national instrument. It was the first to be used in
their musical competitions, and helped in the forming of
the Greek modes. These were of two types, the lyre and
the kithara. The first lyres which came down from the age
of myths and fables were originally made of the shell of a
tortoise and had four strings (the tetrachord) and later
seven and even more strings. This form of the lyre was
called <i><span lang="it">chelys</span></i>, or the tortoise, and was used for accompanying
drinking songs and popular love songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>kithara</em> was also called lyre, but was not made of the
body of the tortoise, and it became the Greek concert
instrument, and was only used by professionals, while the
<i><span lang="it">chelys</span></i> was used in the home. It came originally from Asia
Minor and Egypt. It had four strings at first but these
were gradually added to, until there were fifteen and eighteen
strings. It was sometimes small and sometimes large,
and was held to the body by means of a sling and was
played with a plectrum or pick.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Greek flute or <em>aulos</em> was a wood-wind instrument
more like our oboe than our flute. It was usually played
in pairs, that is, one person played two flutes or <em>auloi</em> of
different sizes at one time, and they were V shaped. There
was a group of <em>auloi</em> differing in range like the human voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>differs, and covering three octaves from the bass <em>aulos</em> to
the soprano.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>aulos</em> was first a single wooden pipe with three or
four finger holes which later were increased to fifteen or
sixteen so that the three modes Dorian, Phrygian and
Lydian, could be played on one pair of <em>auloi</em>. About six
centuries before the Christian era, the double flute became
the instrument of the Delphian and Pythian musical
competitions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the chorus too, we read that for each drama there was a
special <em>aulos</em> soloist who always played the double flute.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were other type instruments such as the war
trumpets, trumpets used in the temple services, and harps
(<em>magadis</em>) that were brought from Egypt, but the real
instruments of the Greeks pictured in their sculpture and
on their vases and urns, and spoken of in their literature,
are the lyres and auloi.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Roman Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Romans, law givers, world conquerors and road
builders, gave little new to music, for they did not show a
great talent for art. They were influenced by Greek ideals
and Greek methods. They were warlike by nature, and
from defenders of their state they became conquerors. As
they grew nationally stronger and more secure, they
learned music, oratory, architecture and sculpture from
Greek teachers. Many Romans well known in history
were singers and gifted players on the Greek kithara, lyre,
and flute (aulos).</p>

<p class='c008'>The Romans seemed to have cared more about the performing
of music than for the composing of it, and “offered
prizes to those who had the greatest dexterity, could blow
the loudest or play the fastest.” (Familiar Talks on
History of Music.—Gantvoort.)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>As they come to America today the musicians of other
lands flocked to Rome, especially those who played or
sang, because they were received with honor and were
richly paid.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Romans, among them Boethius (6th century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),
wrote treatises on the Greek modes, were very much interested
in the theory of music, and built their scales like the
Greeks. To each of the seven tones within an octave
they gave the name of a planet, and to every fourth tone
which was the beginning of a new tetrachord, the name of a
day of the week which is named for the planet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Greeks brought their instrument, the <em>kithara</em>, to
Rome, and with it a style of song called a <em>kitharoedic chant</em>,
which was usually a hymn sung to some god or goddess.
The words, until three hundred years after the birth of
Jesus, were in the Greek language; the Latin kitharoedic
songs like those of the poets Horace and Catullus were sung
at banquets and private parties, Cicero too, was musical.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Edward MacDowell in <cite>Critical and Historical Essays</cite>,
says that instrumental music was no longer used merely to
accompany voices and had become quite independent.
The flute (aulos) players performed better than the lyre and
kithara players and were liked better. They played
“dressed in long feminine, saffron (yellow)-colored robes,
with veiled faces, and straps around their cheeks to support
the muscles of the mouth.” They played with an astonishing
amount of technical skill. “Even women became flute
players, although this was considered disgraceful.” The
prices paid to these flute players were higher than the
amounts received by our opera singers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Roman theatre, unlike the Greek, was not a place
to honor their gods. Greek plays, both tragedy and comedy,
were replaced with pantomime, usually accompanied
by orchestra and singing. The orchestra was made up of
“cymbals, gongs, castanets, foot castanets, rattles, flutes,
bagpipes, gigantic lyres, and a kind of shell or crockery
cymbals, which were clashed together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Roman <em>tibia</em> or bagpipe is still popular today with
the peasants of Italy. Although the bagpipe is first mentioned
in Rome, there are some Persian terra cotta figures
made before the Roman era, showing players of the bagpipes.
It is always said that Nero played the fiddle while
Rome burned and even our motion pictures show him playing
the violin to the accompaniment of flames. How could
he have played on a violin when it had not as yet been invented?
If he played any instrument while Rome burned,
it was probably the tibia.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>To hear two Chinamen exchanging greetings on a street
corner, you would think they were singing or
rather chanting, not because their tones are particularly
pleasant for they are high and nasal and hard, but because
they are talking in their own peculiar way. The Chinese
have what is called an inflected language in which they use
many tones. For example the syllable “hi” in one tone
will mean one thing and it will mean something else entirely
in each different inflection. Here again is a case where it
is hard to say where speech ends and song begins. Another
amusing thing about the Chinese is the way, according to
our ideas, they seem to twist every thing around, so that
what we call high tones they call low tones; they wear
white for mourning and we wear black; their guests of
honor sit at the left of the host and ours sit at the right;
they consider taking off the hat very bad manners and of
course we consider it bad manners for a man to keep it on
in the house or when talking to a lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>They never used their music as a way of expressing beauty
as other nations have done, but treated it as we would a
problem in arithmetic or a cross-word puzzle, and they
loved to write articles on the subject that would seem long
and dull to us. However, as far back as 2255 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Ta Shao
composed a piece of music which Confucius, 1600 years
later, said, “enchanted him to such an extent that he did
not know the taste of food for months.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This shows that music must have been limited to a very
few subjects.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the scale of five steps was changed into a scale of
seven steps about 600 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, every one thought that the end
of music had come. However these two new notes B and
E which formed half steps in the scale were given very interesting
names: Leader and Mediator. We, today, call B
the leading tone, and E the mediant, so in this case, the
Chinese were not quite so topsy-turvy as usual. But in
true Chinese fashion they thought that a mythical bird
Fung-Woang and his mate had invented the steps and the
half steps. The whole steps to them stood for perfect
and independent things such as heaven, sun and man; the
half steps stood for dependent things such as earth, moon
and woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had 84 scales! Think of that and be happy! For
we have only two modes, major and minor, and twelve
different sounding scales in each.</p>

<p class='c008'>We get very little pleasure out of Chinese melodies for
they seem to wander about aimlessly and do not end comfortably,
nor do they seem to begin anywhere! The best
melodies are found among the oldest sacred music and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>among the songs of the sailors and mountaineers. The
sacred hymns and the songs of the people have come down
unchanged from earliest times. The music of their theatres
we like least of all as it is sing-sing, shrill and nerve racking.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is an example of an ancient hymn in the pentatonic
scale:</p>

</div>
</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Instruments</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>How the Chinese like noise! Their orchestras are
seventy-five percent noise makers: drums of all kinds and
sizes, bells, stones beaten with mallets, cymbals, wooden
clappers, a row of tuned stones and copper plates strung up
to be hammered, and wooden tubs beaten sometimes from
the inside and sometimes from the outside. They also
have wind instruments of clay and flutes of bamboo and
metal. The <i><span lang="it">cheng</span></i>, their most pleasing wind instrument, is
made of a hollow gourd with bamboo tubes of different
lengths inserted. Their most popular stringed instruments
are the <em>kin</em>, a primitive guitar, and the <em>cha</em>, a sort of large
zither with twenty-five strings. These instruments date
back to barbaric times.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most curious that we have come across is the
<em>king</em> which is supposed to have been invented by <i><span lang="it">Quei</span></i>, a
mythical youth like the Greek Orpheus. It is a rack hung
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>with two rows of sixteen different sized stones, which are
struck with a wooden mallet. This instrument goes back
to 2300 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> It seemed so important to the Chinese that
they have a special kind of <em>king</em> called the <em>nio-king</em> upon
which only the Emperor could play. Another little instrument
almost as queer as the <em>king</em>, made of slats of wood tied
together and shaped like a fan, used to beat time, was called
the <em>tchoung-tou</em>. It was held in one hand and struck against
the palm of the other much as one would play with a
fan.</p>

<p class='c008'>In making their instruments, the Chinese used eight
different sounds in nature which they found musical—the
sound of skin (drums), stone (<em>king</em> and <em>nio-king</em>), metal
(flutes, bells, gongs, cymbals and trumpets), clay (instrument
like an ocarina moulded into fantastic animal shapes),
wood (drums and boxes), bamboo (flutes and parts of the
<i><span lang="it">cheng</span></i>), silk (strings on the <i><span lang="it">che</span></i> and <em>king</em> and other stringed
instruments), gourds (sound boards which held the tubes of
the <i><span lang="it">cheng</span></i>, one of the ancestors of the modern organ).</p>

<p class='c008'>As early as the 5th century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, one of the first books
on music in the world was written by a friend of Confucius,
the great teacher and philosopher. We know about the
ancient Chinese music, not from hieroglyphics and parchments,
but from the music they use today, which is the same
as that of barbaric times. The law against new things prevailed
there as it did in Egypt, and where the government
controls art, there can be little progress.</p>

<p class='c008'>However we might have known much more about music
had not Emperor She Huang-Ti “the book destroyer”
ordered all musical instruments and books to be destroyed
(246 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) except those about medicine, agriculture and
magic. For generations after, the people heard little music
but the noise of tumbling bells and dancers’ drums.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their popular music has always been very poor with no
particular form or system.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Japanese Music</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>From the many Japanese prints, and cups and bowls
decorated with fascinating pictures of the dainty little men
and women playing the <em>samisen</em> and <em>koto</em>, we feel as if we
had met these far away people before.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>koto</em> and the <em>samisen</em> have remained unchanged for
hundreds of years. It is said that the <em>koto</em> was first made of
several hunting bows placed side by side and that later they
were joined together as one long sounding board across
which the strings were drawn. In the prints we see the
long zither-like instruments lying flat on the floor and the
dainty little players in fancy kimonos beside them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps in the same print a companion will be seen playing
a <em>samisen</em>, a long necked instrument whose strings are
plucked with a pick or plectrum, such as we use for the
mandolin. Whether these prints are a hundred years old
or the work of an artist today, makes little difference, for
we find the instrument unchanged and the little player in
the same lovely kimono. These instruments have been in
use in Japan for hundreds of years.</p>

<p class='c008'>The music and instruments of the Japanese are very like
those of the Chinese, not only because they are of like race,
but because the Japanese are great imitators and have
borrowed from China not only music but art. The Japanese
love music for itself, not as the Chinese love it as subject
for debate, but they have not written any better music
than their neighbors on the mainland.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you have listened to the music of <cite>Madame Butterfly</cite>,
an opera by Giacomo Puccini, you will have heard a number
of Japanese melodies, some of which are real. The composers
of Europe and America love to imitate the oriental
music because it gives them a chance to make effects quite
different from those possible in our own music. Besides,
the oriental people seem very picturesque to us and stir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>our imagination. Henry Eichheim of Boston has written
Chinese and Japanese Impressions in which he has used
many of the native instruments,—bells, rattles and drums.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Japanese have great love of beauty which shows itself
in their festivals, held in the spring when the cherry
trees blossom and azaleas bloom. Then, too, their Geisha
dances are full of grace and have the most winning names,
such as, Leaf of Gold and the Butterfly dance. At the time
of the festivals bands of musicians and dancers rove from
place to place in gay costumes and add greatly to the fun.
The Geisha girls are trained to sing and dance to the accompaniment
of the <em>koto</em> and <em>samisen</em> to amuse the
people.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Japanese and Chinese are Buddhists, or worshippers
of the prophet Buddha. In their temples they chant the
whole service on one note accompanied by the sound of
cymbals and the tolling of a deep rich gong. We know these
gongs for we have often been called to dinner by them in
America.</p>

<p class='c008'>About 200 years ago a musician named Yatsubashi, the
father of Japanese national music, invented a way of writing
down music for the <em>koto</em>. Each string has a number and
this number is set down and is read from top to bottom instead
of from left to right on the staff, as we read music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of late years Japan has been interested in European
customs and has adopted so many of them that they are
called the “Frenchmen of the East.” Among other things
that they imitate is our musical system. So today they
have symphony concerts and piano and song recitals in
which they hear European artists and they themselves
perform music of our composers. They send many of their
young people to Europe and America to study music.
This may lead to discarding their own music in time even
as they are giving up the kimono, for our less picturesque
costume.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Siamese, Burmese and Javanese</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The yellow races seem to like the same kind of music
and use almost the same instruments. Nevertheless each
nation has its own special instruments. For example, the
Burmese have a drum organ made of twenty-one drums of
different sizes, hung inside of a great hoop; they also have a
gong organ in which fifteen or more gongs of different sizes
and tones are strung inside a hoop. The player sits or
stands inside the hoop and plays the surrounding gongs.
Sometimes it looks very funny to see a procession in which
this instrument is carried by two men while a third walks
along inside a hoop, striking the gongs not only at the side
and in front of him but also behind him. (Figure 14.)</p>

<p class='c008'>This instrument is a very important part of the Javanese
orchestra called the <em>gamelon</em> in Java. Their particular
musical possession is the <em>anklong</em>, a set of bamboo tubes
sounded by striking them. We have heard some Javanese
songs sung by Eva Gauthier and we found great beauty in
them. Many of these songs are centuries old.</p>

<p class='c008'>In these countries the people are very fond of making
musical instruments which look like animals and the things
they see around them, as for instance, the Burmese <em>soung</em>, a
thirteen stringed harp, with a boat shaped body and a
prettily curved neck. Think, too, of playing as they do in
Burma and Siam on a harp or zither shaped like a crocodile!
(Figures 12 and 13.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The Siamese use more wind instruments than the people
of other Oriental lands. When Edward MacDowell, our
famous composer, heard the Siamese Royal Orchestra in
London, he decided that each musician made up his part
as he went along, the only rule being to keep up with each
other and to finish together. The fact that they thought
they were doing a really lovely thing made the concert
seem very comical. But the Orientals can return the compliment.
A few years ago the Chinese government sent
some students to study in Berlin but after a month’s time
they asked to be called home because, “It would be folly,”
they said, “to remain in a barbarous country where even
the most elementary principles of music had not been
grasped.” (From <cite>Critical and Historical Essays</cite> of Edward
MacDowell.)</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Incas and Aztecs</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Before leaving the Orientals, we want to cross the bridge
with you between the Orient (East) and the Occident
(West). Sometimes we find the same customs and ways of
doing things in places very far apart. Sometimes this likeness
will appear in a religious ceremony, a dance or song, a
piece of pottery, or in a musical instrument. To find these
similarities makes one believe that at sometime in the
world’s history, these people so far away from each other,
must have been closely related. Such a likeness can be
traced in the music of the ancient Chinese and the Aztecs
of Mexico, and the Incas of Peru, some of which has been
sung to us by Marguerite d’Alvarez, from Peru. The
Peruvians played pipes and had music in the same rhythm
as the sacred chants of the Chinese. The Mexicans had all
kinds of drums, rattles, stones, gongs, bells and cymbals
which resemble the Chinese instruments. On the other
hand we read in Prescott’s <cite>Conquest of Peru</cite> of a Sun Festival
which recalls the Sun Dance of our own American Indian.
The Inca or the ruler of Peru, his court and the entire population
of the city met at dawn in June and with the first
rays of the sun, thousands of wind instruments broke forth
into “a majestic song of adoration” accompanied by thousands
of shouting voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the kind of instruments that the Aztecs in Mexico
used, we know that their music was more barbaric than that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of the Peruvians. A curious combination of love for music
and barbarism is shown in the custom they had of appointing
each year a youth to act as the God of music, whose
name <cite>Tezcatlipoca</cite>, he was given. He was presented with
a beautiful bride and for the one year he lived like a
prince in the greatest luxury. He learned to play the flute
and whenever the people heard it, they fell down and worshipped
him! But this wonderful life was not all it seemed,
for at the end of the year the beautiful youth was offered as
a living sacrifice to the blood-thirsty God of Music whom
he was impersonating.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='c016'>The Arab Spreads Culture—The Gods Give Music to the Hindus</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Arabia is the southwestern peninsula of Asia and is
bounded by the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Arabian
Sea. It was well situated to come in contact with the
ancient nations of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>This story of Arabia and its music will include all those
peoples to whom the Arabs gave of their learning. Saracen,
Mussulman, Mohammedan and Islamite are different
names for the same people, but they are all Arabs, even
though they are not Arabians living in Arabia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arab music fills in the gaps between the ancient civilizations,
the beginnings of early Christian music and the time
of the Minnesingers and the Troubadours.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the years we call the Dark Ages (500 to 1300 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>),
Europe was in a semi-barbarous state and there was little
learning outside of the monasteries. All the culture and
advances made by the Greeks and Romans seemed in danger
of perishing in the raids and attacks of barbarous tribes,
and wars among the early European peoples. But the
Arabs, on whom we look today as almost barbarians, were
the highly cultured race of that far-off time.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were great mathematicians and from them we have
Algebra and our Arabic numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. From
them we have the arabesques, or the intricate geometric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>designs in carvings and traceries, seen on buildings in the
countries where the Arabs built, lived, roamed or studied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long before the Christian era there were very wonderful
Arabian universities in Bagdad and Damascus, so famous
that they attracted many Greek and Hebrew scholars to
learn from the Arabian philosophers and wise men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mohammed, their greatest prophet, who was born in
570 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, wrote their holy book called the <cite>Koran</cite>. While
he lived the Arabs were at the height of their power.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because they had studied the learning of the past, and
had invaded and conquered parts of Europe, the Arabs
brought to Europe their arts and sciences and the learning
of the ancient nations. Through their conquests they also
carried their ways of living into the countries of the barbarians.
For example, in 711, they drove the Goths out
from Spain and set up their own caliphs (rulers) in that
country, so that at this time they had two capitals—the
original Bagdad and one at Cordova. From these Arabs,
who came from Mauretania in Africa to Spain, descended
the people we call Moors. It is for this reason that we have
traces of Arab music and the Moorish architecture or Arab-like
buildings of which the Alhambra is best known, in
Spain. In Cordova, grew up a center of learning, far
greater than any in the surrounding countries. At the
university was a library of over 600,000 manuscripts not
yet in book form, for printing had not been invented.
Here, too, great chemists studied and discovered alcohol,
sulphuric and nitric acids. The clock also was invented by
the Arabs, and the game of chess was first thought out when
the Chinese were already playing Mah Jong! They were
responsible, too, for trigonometry as well as algebra, and
they knew how to make cotton goods, and were famous for
the Damascus steel out of which the swords of the heroes
for many generations were forged. Even today Damascus
steel is looked upon as excellent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>As they were worshippers of Mohammed, they were not
permitted to make portraits of human beings in stone or on
parchments for they believed that they would be deprived
of their souls at the day of judgment should they reproduce
the human form. So they put their artistic efforts into
color and design.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not satisfied with their conquest of the Goths, they decided
to enter France, but were kept out by Emperor
Charlemagne who thought differently, and stopped them.
It was due to this conflict that the great epic <cite><span lang="fr">La Chanson de
Roland</span></cite> (The Song of Roland) was written.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came the Crusades, the expeditions which went on
for many years to wrest the shrine of the Saviour from the
hand of the Mussulman. These wars continued so long,
that nearly every European group of people came in contact
with the Arab, and in so doing, learned much from
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Arab was a courageous, loyal person, proud and ready
to die for his own ideas; he was courtly, yet careful in all
business dealings and many of his traits were passed on to
his descendants. Very rapidly the rough warrior of the
desert was transformed into a luxury-loving, cultured man.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Arabians seemed to be great musical blotters; because
they blotted up or absorbed music wherever they went
and made it theirs! But they were unlike blotters for
loving it; they made a science of it and passed it on to other
nations and thence to us.</p>

<p class='c008'>So much of the Persian music was absorbed by the Arab
that it would be difficult to separate them in our story.
The Arabs took the very loosely-put-together music of
Persia and made it over into better form. Even before the
Mohammedan conquests (700–800 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), Arab music was
well planned, and as they spread later to North Africa,
Egypt, Morocco, Greece, Italy, and Spain, they left some
traces of their own music and took something of the music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of the natives. Furthermore, they adopted many of the
instruments that they found and they became the ancestors
of some of our own.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ancient Arabs did not write down their music, but
handed it on from musician to musician, gaining and losing
very little from the many hands through which it passed.
They have none of what we call harmony or accompaniment,
as in their orchestras all the instruments except the
drums play the same tune; the drums mark the time and
often play very complicated rhythms. This makes their
music sound confused to us, but by hearing it often you
learn in what an orderly way it is done, and you will see
why many people like it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The caliphs (rulers) had court musicians and probably
more music was played and more scientific treatises on
music were written by these people than by any other
mediæval or ancient race.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Arab Scales</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>There has been much argument about Arab music as to
whether the scale was divided into seventeen steps or eight,
as is our scale. Some people think they hear it as seventeen
tones divided into one-third steps, but Baron d’Erlanger,
a great authority on ancient Arab music, says that there
are two distinct musical systems still in use. One comes
from their ancient home in Asia, and the other from the
Pharaohs of Egypt. And the fact that these two systems
have been mixed in using them leads to the question of what
the real scale is. Baron d’Erlanger finds, as the result of
his experiments, that if we could lower, ever so slightly, the
third and seventh tones of our scale, we would have the
old Pharaoh scale in its simplest form. The other scales
can be played on stringed instruments on which there are
no fixed tones as there are on a keyboard instrument like a
piano, and can therefore play the intervals that do not
exist on the piano.</p>

<div id='i_058'  class='figcenter id006'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>Laura Williams, American Singer of Arab Songs, in Native Costume, Accompanying Herself on El oud (the Lute).</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>It is impossible to say how many scales or modes the
Arabs use, because each change of the tiniest part of a step
creates a new mode, and there are many combinations
possible. Some say that there are thirty-four modes;
another says that there are twenty-four, one for each hour
of the day. There are also modes for the four elements—fire,
water, earth, and air; for the twelve signs of the zodiac,
and for the seven planets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each mode has a name, called after all sorts of things like
cities or tribes or ornaments, in fact, anything familiar to
the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>The weird effects made by the <em>Gloss</em> or musical ornaments
like the trill, grace notes and slidings give the music a
dreamy fascinating character, the charm of which is increased
by its frequent changes from double to triple time,
or from triple to double.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Instruments</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is through the instruments that we can trace the Arab
influence in our own music. When we come to the story of
the Troubadours, you will see them using the lute, the principal
instrument of the Middle Ages. This was called
<em>el oud</em>, which gradually became <em>lute</em>, because the Europeans
heard the words that way.</p>

<p class='c008'>So you can see here, how art travels through the chances
and changes of wars, wanderings, conquests and political
shiftings of power among the different nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the Arab instruments are of Persian, Egyptian
and Greek origin, but as we said above, the Arab became so
mixed with other peoples of the world, that in wandering
about, what is really theirs in music or instruments, or
what was borrowed from others, is difficult to tell. But we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>can tell you that the popular music of the Arab, as you hear
it today, in bazaars and cafés of Northern Africa and in
parts of Asia where Arabs are still to be found, has remained
practically unchanged throughout the centuries. Even the
instruments are the same.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>El oud</em> still remains the popular instrument and shares
its popularity with the <em>kanoun</em>, which is probably of Persian
origin. This <em>kanoun</em> is like a zither, and is specially tuned
for every scale. It is said that the Arab spends three-quarters
of his life tuning his instruments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Baron Rodolphe d’Erlanger, an Englishman living in
Tunis, has spent twelve years studying the ancient Arabian
music in order to preserve it, for it is dying out through the
arrival of modern European civilization accompanied by
phonographs, jazz and radios.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their viols are of real interest because it is claimed that
they are the ancestors of the great violin family. These
ancestors are of different styles and are called the <em>rebab</em>
and <em>kemangeh</em>, sometimes played with the bow and sometimes
without. They have <em>kissars</em> and <em>lyres</em> and various
forms of zithers, besides the <em>kanoun</em>. The Arabs’ fondness
for strings is proof that they were indeed sensitive and
fine, while most of their neighbors liked the drums and
brasses much more, showing a lower grade of civilization.
By this we do not mean that the Arabs were not fond of their
drums, because the drum was one of the chief features of
their music. Indeed they had many kinds—the <em>atambal</em>
which looks like two kettle-drums hitched together; the
<em>derbouka</em> which is really a vase with a skin stretched over
the base; the <em>taar</em> like our tambourine; the <em>bendaair</em>, an
open faced shallow drum, with snares (cords) stretched
across inside the head somewhat like our own snare drum;
and the <em>dof</em>, a squarish drum played with the hands and
knuckles like the <em>taar</em>, but with the snares. The Hebrews
had an instrument like this called the <em>tof</em> or <em>toph</em> and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Persians also had the <em>dof</em> or <em>duff</em>. So, here again, you see
how one nation affects the other. (Figure 8.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they had flutes called the <em>ijaouak</em> and <em>gosba</em> with
three or more holes, which they used for sad tunes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every visitor to a Mohammedan country is introduced to
Arab religious music at day-break, noon and sun-down, by
the muezzin (priest) who calls the faithful of Mohammed to
prayer, from an opening in the tower of a mosque. This
call has been handed down to the Mohammedans from a
time even before the coming of Mohammed (6th century
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The Gods Give Music to the Hindus</span></p>

<p class='c008'>There had been so much conquest and battling in India,
that although we know much about Hindu music it is very
difficult to tell what really belonged to the Hindus and what
was brought to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The native legends tell us that the gods gave music to
the people and all through the music there are signs to show
their power and influence. The literature of India can be
traced back many centuries and through it we see what an
important place song held. There were minstrels in the
ancient courts whose duty it was to chant songs in praise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of their royal masters. In their religious ceremonies, too,
music held a high place. One of their holy books says:
“Indra (their chief god) rejects the offering made without
music.” The Hindu people are divided into many classes,
which they call castes, and in ancient times the singers
were members of the priest caste. The Hindus love music
and have always used it for all festivities, in the drama, and
in the temples.</p>

<p class='c008'>The singing of poems from ancient time has always been
popular and dancing too, and here, as among the Japanese,
have grown up trained dancers called the Bayaderes or
Nautch girls. (Chapter V).</p>

<p class='c008'>Music is still used in India to appease and please the gods
and to plead for rain or sunshine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Travelers to India relate that they have heard the beating
of drums, accompanied by solo voice or by a chorus, continued
for several days at a time. When there has been a
drought, and rain is needed, this long drawn out music is
used as a means to ask the god to bring rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Temple of the Sacred Tooth in Ceylon (India) on
each night of the full moon, the sacred books are chanted by
relays of yellow-robed priests, following each other every
two hours from dark to dawn. They chant in deep resounding
voices without a pause. The Buddhist priests have repeated
these sacred texts on every night of the full moon for
twenty-eight centuries!</p>

<p class='c008'>In India they have made a deep study of color and sound
and things we know very little about, and to which we
attach very little importance. Through their study of the
laws of sound and color, the Hindus feel sure that they are
related. Edward Maryon in “Marcotone” says: “Chemistry
and Mathematics prove that the Natural Scales of
Light and Sound in Principle are one, and therefore the
Primary Colors of the Solar Spectrum, and the Primary
Tones of the Musical Scale have the same <em>ratio</em> of speed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>vibrations. Therefore both <em>Tone</em> and <em>Color</em> can be scaled
so that a given number of Lightspeeds (Colors), will equal
a given number of Soundwaves (Tones).”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Edward Maryon was in India he visited one of the
temples and in watching the prayer wheels, noticed that a
certain wheel moving at a certain speed produced a certain
sound and a certain color, while another wheel moving at
a different speed produced a different tone and a different
color. It interested him so much that he learned from a
Hindu priest about the relation of light and sound. This led
to very interesting experiments and results which he has
used in teaching music. The color red is supposed to
correspond with the musical sound middle C, orange with
D, yellow with E, green with F, blue with G, indigo with A,
and violet with B. And recently in America we have been
interested in seeing a color organ, the “Clavilux” invented
by Thomas Wilfred which plays tones of colors instead of
tones of sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is a direct twentieth century result of the so-called
“magic” of primitive times. From this you can see how
the magic of ancient days is explained by modern science.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hindu Rags</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Hindu songs presided over by special gods were called
<em>rags</em>, but of course, the name has no relationship whatever
to our <em>ragtime</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems that religious feeling has dominated everything
in the Orient; for this reason every idea connected with
music has a corresponding idea in Hindu mythology. The
<em>rags</em> were all named after the gods who brought music down
from heaven to comfort man. The character of each god or
goddess was supposed to be reflected in the <em>rag</em>, and it was
not the result of scientific study as were, for instance, the
scales of the Chinese. Our knowledge of the <em>rag</em> has come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>down to us from what Sanskrit writers on Indian music have
said, and what is practised today by the modern Hindu.
No doubt Arabia and Persia once had a music system very
much like this one of the Hindus.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Rags</em>, <em>ragas</em>, or <em>raginis</em> were neither airs nor modes in our
sense of the words, but something like the modes of the
Arab songs, they were melodic forms, or themes, on which
musicians either improvised or composed new songs, by
using them in rhythms of endless variety.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were many many <em>rags</em>, and they were under the
guidance of the gods of the rainy season, the cold season, the
mild, the hot, etc., and could only be sung during their
special seasons. It was thought that these songs sung at
the wrong time would bring down calamity. Again, as
with the American Indian (Chapter II), we find tribes who
are most careful to sing certain music at certain times.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is told that a Hindu nobleman, long ago, tried to sing
a night song in the daytime and darkness covered all things
within the sound of his voice!</p>

<p class='c008'>As important as was the song from the earliest time, instrumental
music held almost an equal place.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Orchestra</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Hindu orchestra is sometimes large and sometimes
small. Its dances are lively and vigorous, and very seldom
slow and romantic. Nevertheless they have many kinds of
songs, some lively and some not, such as: songs in honor of
Krishna (one of their principal gods), official odes, war
hymns, love songs, evening songs, wedding songs, cradle
and patriotic songs. In some, the Arab seems to have
influenced the Hindu music, because they have the lively
rhythm and the variety of the Arab music, yet it is difficult
to know which one influenced the other. The Arab music
has the variety and luxurious soft beauty in popular dances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>equal to anything our modern musicians or poets have composed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The playing of instruments, accompanying songs with
Sanskrit texts, was supposed to give energy, develop heroism,
make a peaceful heart, and drive away harm and
impurity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The members of the different castes or sects had and still
have meetings held sometimes in private houses and sometimes
in the temples, when they sang religious hymns.
Among the higher classes, they went to the expense of
having good musicians and of giving artistic performances,
but among the common people, their idea was that the
greater the noise the more they showed their devotion, so
they sang, beat drums and blew whistles without any regard
for time or melody, and you can imagine the effect
was pandemonium.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Notation</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is impossible to write the Hindu music in European
notation, because instead of dividing the scale into semi-tones
or half-steps, they use quarter tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Margaret Glyn, in her book, <cite>Evolution of Musical Form</cite>,
writes:</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the East notation is in an elementary condition,
the staff being unknown. The Hindus, Chinese, and
Abyssinians have ancient note-signs, consisting of a kind of
letter to which some indication of time is added, but in
this respect the Chinese system is wanting, having practically
no time-notation. Probably note-signs existed in
Persia and Arabia, but these do not appear to have survived.
The modern Arabic notation is but three hundred years old,
and is said to have been invented by one Demetrius de
Cantemir who adapted the letters of the Turkish alphabet
for the purpose. This has eighteen tones to the octave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>(we have twelve), and is used in Turkey and other countries
of the near East.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Hindus seem to like both triple (3 beats) and duple
(2 or 4 beats) rhythm. The scheme changes according to
the poetry of the song, and the pitch and the length of tones
are shown by Sanskrit characters and special signs or words.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Instruments</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Hindus have spent much time in studying music and
the instruments of which they have many kinds. There
are the strings, there are skins sounded by beating, instruments
struck together in pairs, and those that are blown.
They like the strings best. The characteristic instrument
is the <em>vina</em>, usually of wood or bamboo strengthened by one
to three gourds as sounding boards, and having five or
seven wire strings played something like the zither, but
sometimes with a bow. (Figure 16.) There are many
varieties of the <em>sitar</em>, an instrument like a lute, and many
viols of which the <em>sarinda sarunja</em> is typical and is played
with a bow. (Figure 17.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the percussion instruments are tambourines,
castanets and cymbals; they had wind instruments such as
flutes (seldom transverse or blown in from the side, and
often played by blowing on them through the nostrils),
trumpets, horns, bagpipes and oboes. Certain instruments
were used only by the priests, others by beggars, and
others by dancing girls. Imagine how weird a story could
be told in music if a modern symphony orchestra played a
piece of music telling of life among the Hindus. Maybe
some of the readers of this book will get an idea for a Hindu
tone poem, who knows?</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c016'>What Church Music Imported from Greece</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>During the centuries when the Eastern nations were
powerful the European continent was inhabited by
primitive men, who had gradually formed tribes. They had
rude songs, dances, and crude instruments. They used
their music in religious ceremonies, to celebrate war victories
and successful hunting expeditions, to sing to their
sweethearts, and to accompany their work in the fields and
homes, much as the American Indian did. Many manners
and customs of the Anglo-Saxon (English), Teutonic
(German), Norse (Danish, Swedish and Norwegian),
Celtic (Irish) and Gallic (French) races may be traced back
to these barbaric days, and even the beginning of national
schools of music may be found.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although a thousand years passed between the Greek
musical era and the “Golden Age” of Christian Church
music, much that happened in that time is hidden in darkness.
The nations and tribes were fighting for existence
and were developing into the nations which we know today.</p>

<p class='c008'>Islam or the Mohammedan religion, and not Christianity,
was the great influence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Julius Cæsar (100–44 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), the great Roman General,
conquered Gallia (France), then invaded the land of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Teutons (Germany) and even reached England. In parts
of northern Europe, one still sees the remains of great roadways,
aqueducts or water works, and bridges, that the
Romans built during their invasions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Cluny Museum in Paris is a great hall built as a
bath by the Romans. In Bath, England, the city was
named for the ancient Roman baths still existing, and you
can see the pipe lines which carried the water.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dark Ages</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The world at that time was not a happy place in which
to live. There was constant warfare between the once
powerful Roman Empire and these barbaric tribes. The
poorest people were oppressed and many were slaves, bought
and sold by the rich land owners and army leaders.</p>

<p class='c008'>Into such a world was the child, Jesus, born—a world
with little love for humanity, little unselfishness, little
sympathy for the down-trodden and unhappy, few kind
words for the poor or the sick, little justice and less mercy.
No wonder that His teachings brought new life and gave
hope to the people!</p>

<p class='c008'>For several centuries following the birth of Christ, the
world went through a period called the Dark Ages. Rome,
the city of glorious victories and brilliant culture became
the prey of the barbaric tribes—Huns, Goths, Visigoths,
Vandals, Franks, Saxons, and Slavs,—until it seemed that
civilization would be wiped out and people would become
primitive again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Music was saved during the Dark Ages through a small
band of faithful followers of Jesus Christ, who founded a
church in His name. That their music should have been
made up of existing tunes and words is very natural.
Jesus, himself, brought up in the religion of the Hebrews,
often sang the Psalms of David. The beautiful traditional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>music of the Jewish synagogues found its way into the services
of the early Christian Church, because many of the
believers were Hebrews. Soon the Hebrew Bible texts
were translated into Latin—the everyday language of the
Romans, and as most of these early Christians lived in
Rome, they followed the rules of music the Romans learned
from the Greeks. So, our Church music was influenced
both by the Hebrews and Greeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>For about three hundred years the early Christians had
to hold their services in secret, as they were punished even
by death when caught, for not worshipping Jupiter and the
Roman gods. They were not rich and influential, but
just humble folk to whom the teachings of Jesus came as
a joyous comfort. They had no beautiful palaces where
they could hold services, and at the same time hide from
the Roman centurions, so they worshipped in dark and
secret places and could not have much music as it would
have attracted the attention of their enemies. The early
Christians shunned music, too, because it had been used
for the wild dances and festivals of their pagan oppressors.
As they were poor and uneducated, they had had little
training and lacked money to buy instruments, so all in all
music had a hard time to keep alive.</p>

<p class='c008'>From what we can gather, they chanted their Psalms
much as did the Hebrews and had responses which sounded
like soft and monotonous droning.</p>

<p class='c008'>As time went on emperors like Constantine, began to
take away the death penalty from those believing in Christ
and gradually as the Romans saw the beauty of His
teachings they became Christians in increasing numbers.
Many of these Romans came from the upper classes, and as
Greek was the language of culture they had had a thorough
Greek education and owned many instruments, so they
brought their Greek musical inheritance to the growing
band.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Thus, the chants composed in Rome for the <em>kithara</em> were
the direct ancestors of our Christian hymns. These early
hymns were also a bridge between the single melody line
of the Orient and Greece and Rome, and the many melody
lines, called polyphonic music, of Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 325 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, Emperor Constantine made Christianity the
national religion of Rome. He also founded the Christian
Church in Byzantium, later called Constantinople, and all
through the Dark Ages, in many parts of Europe, the cathedrals
and church schools were the only gleam of learning in a
time of darkness and struggle.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the Roman Empire reached its greatest height, in
the 2nd century, it gradually grew weaker and during the
4th and 5th centuries, the Goths, Vandals and Huns drove
the government from Rome to Constantinople. In the
7th century Mohammedanism rose and swept over Syria,
Egypt and North Africa, and reached Spain in the 8th
century.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Answering Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is related that St. Ignatius (49–107 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) one of the
early Christian fathers, had a vision in which he heard the
Heavenly choirs praising the Holy Trinity, in alternating
chants, and he was so impressed by it, that he introduced
into the Church the idea of two choirs of singers answering
each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>In singing the Psalms of David, the Hebrews used this
idea of antiphonal music. (Anti—against, phonal—sounding:
antiphonal—sounding against each other.) We see it
too in the Greek choruses, in the Roman kitharoedic chants
(chants accompanied by the <em>kithara</em>), and now in the
early Christian hymns. From this antiphonal music to the
later polyphony (poly—many, phony—sounds: many voices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>or parts) is a natural step. Here again is an instance of the
influence of one nation on another.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Patron Saint of Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Among the martyrs to the cause of the Christian faith,
was St. Cecilia, a member of a noble Roman family, who
was put to death for becoming a Christian about 177 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
She is believed to be buried in the Roman catacombs
(underground burial chambers) and is the patron saint of
music, and she is supposed to have invented the organ.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was St. Ambrose (333–397 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) who worked out the
first system for church music and put it on a foundation
that lasted for two hundred years.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Greek Modes as Models</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>St. Ambrose built scales modeled on the old Greek modes
and they were given Greek names, but somehow the names
became mixed so that the mode called by Ambrose, Dorian
(from D to D on the white keys of the piano) was the Greek
Phrygian; and the Phrygian (E to E) of Ambrose was called
Dorian by the Greeks; F to F is the Lydian mode; G to G,
the Mixolydian. These were the four authentic <em>Ecclesiastical</em>
or <em>Church Modes</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>St. Ambrose felt it his duty to make over the church music
because popular street songs had crept in with the Hebrew
Psalms and Greek and Roman chants! It was much the
same effect as if you entered a church and heard the organ
and choir performing “Yes, We Have No Bananas.” This is
a funny comparison because it is said that a part of “Yes, We
Have No Bananas” is stolen from Handel’s great “Hallelujah”
Chorus from the oratorio <cite>The Messiah</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>About this time, schools were formed to train singers in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>these new hymns and church services, and a way to write
down the music composed by St. Ambrose and his followers
was needed. The Greek letters had been used in Rome,
but now a new system called <em>neumes</em> appeared; this word
comes from the Greek and means “breath” and the
neumes simply marked where one should breathe in
chanting the hymns. There were eight signs with Latin
names which gave full directions when to raise and lower
the voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The system of Neumes notation looks like our present
day shorthand and was a help, though, should we use it
now we would think it anything but a help.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the Neumes writing showed how to mark the time,
it had a serious shortcoming, because it did not outline the
melody exactly. It indicated whether the melody rose
or fell, but just how much was a question not definitely
shown. An unfamiliar chant could not be sung until the
notation had been worked out. It took five years for a
choir singer to be able to sing the music!</p>

<p class='c008'>When the singers sang solos, they ornamented the songs
and sang anything they pleased! This made variety but it
must also have caused much confusion! The people may
have learned this ornamental singing of the Arab, from <cite>The
Gloss</cite>. (Page 59.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The next step was the Gregorian chant which even today
is sung in the Roman Catholic Churches.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the four authentic scales of St. Ambrose, St. Gregory
who was Pope from 590 to 604 added four more called
<em>plagal</em>. He did not invent these scales but based them
on the old Greek and Ambrosian modes. To each authentic
scale, he added a plagal scale starting four tones below it,
and to the name of the authentic mode is added the prefix
<em>hypo</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each authentic mode and its <em>hypo</em> are related.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is a table of these related modes, and their names:</p>

</table>

<p class='c008'>We have marked the half-steps <em>bc͡</em> and <em>ef͡</em>, and in every
mode they fall on different degrees of the scale. This
shifting of the half-steps tells us the name of the mode.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to try to give you a definite idea of how the
church modes worked, we have written the familiar national
hymn <cite>America</cite> in each mode (see page <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>). Play them, and
you will see how one differs from the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Katherine Ruth Heyman has used a similar idea in her
little book <cite>The Relation of Ultramodern to Archaic Music</cite> in
explaining Greek Modes.</p>

<p class='c008'>It took many years to establish this music and it was not
until the time of Charlemagne (742–814) that it became a
real system called Plain Chant or Plain-song (from the
Latin, <i><span lang="la">cantus planus</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Pope Gregory founded the <cite><span lang="la">Schola Cantorum</span></cite>, school of
singers, at Rome, and with these trained people he tried to
establish for all Christian churches, a way to sing systematically
and well. They studied nine years, and everything
had to be memorized, for only the leader had a song
book. Books were written by hand and were hard to get.
The teacher had a monochord, the instrument invented by
Pythagoras, to give the pitch, for all the singing was done
without accompaniment. The singing must have improved
greatly after Gregory became Pope, for before his reform,
music had become a stunt with no solemnity, and people in
the churches waved handkerchiefs if the stunt pleased them!</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A Long Journey</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>At any rate the Gregorian chant flourished and was so
loved that Benedict Biscop, and other monks interested in
music, came from far-off England to learn the chant invented
by St. Gregory. A long journey! In 675 Biscop
sent to Rome for singers and built monasteries very close to
a pagan temple, where the Anglo-Saxons still worshipped the
Roman Sun god, Apollo, also god of music. These he
filled with beautiful relics, paintings and stained glass
windows, Bibles and service books illuminated in gold and
color, which he brought from Rome.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bringing things from Rome may sound easy to you, but
fancy the travel and inconvenience when there were no
steamships, no railroads, no aeroplanes, but only Roman
roads, which however marvelous, were long and wearisome
by foot or by horse, or mule and rude wagons. This shows
how much the people of Britain desired music and beauty
in their church services.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Venerable Bede</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>About this time, there lived a man in England so loved
and respected that he was called the Venerable Bede.
Although music had no such variety, melody and richness
as today, just see what the Venerable Bede says about it:
“Music is the most worthy, courteous, pleasant, joyous and
lovely of all knowledge; it makes a man gentlemanly in
his demeanor, pleasant, courteous, joyous, lovely, for it
acts upon his feelings. Music encourages us to bear the
heaviest afflictions, administers consolation in every difficulty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>refreshes the broken spirit, removes headache and
cures crossness and melancholy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Isn’t it remarkable for a man to have said this so long
ago, when scientists, today, have just <em>begun</em> to think that
music may have a power of healing ills of the mind and of
the body! Truly—“there is nothing new under the sun!”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Bede used the plain chant of Gregory and through his
influence, spread this dignified music throughout England,
and wherever a monastery was founded, a music school
was started.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Venerable Bede writes that Ethelbert of Kent, King
of Britain, was a worshipper of Odin and Thor, Norse gods,
but he married a French Princess who was a Christian.
One day, writes the Venerable Bede, forty monks led in
solemn procession by St. Augustine, passed before the king
singing a chant. After hearing this marvelous hymn, he
became a Christian and gave permission to the English to
become worshippers of Christ instead of Norse and Druid
gods. This hymn which converted Ethelbert in 597 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
was sung thirteen hundred years later (1897) in the same
place, Canterbury, by another group of Benedictine monks!</p>

<p class='c008'>At first the songs were sung unaccompanied, but later
as in the time of David, the Church allowed instruments.
The lyre and the harp were used first but the cymbals and
the dulcimer, somewhat like our zither, were considered too
noisy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Venerable Bede called music made by instruments
<em>artificial</em> music, and that of the human voice, <em>natural</em> music.
Whether at that time the viol, the drum, the organ or the
psaltery (an instrument like the dulcimer) were used in the
Church, is not known positively.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Bede’s death, Alcuin, a monk and musician, continued
his work. He was appointed by Charlemagne,
Emperor of France, to teach music in the schools of Germany
and France to spread the use of the Gregorian chant.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A Curious Music System</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In 900 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> an important thing happened, by which the
reading and learning of music was much simplified. A
red line was drawn straight across the page and this line
represented “F” the tone on the fourth line of the bass
staff. The <em>neumes</em> written on this red line were “F” and
the others above or below, were of higher or lower pitch.
This worked so well, that they placed a yellow line above
the red line and this they called “C.” These two lines
were the beginnings of our five line staff, but much happened
between the two-line days and the five.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this time people did not sing in parts, known as they
are to us—soprano, alto, tenor, bass, but everybody sang
the same tune, that is, sang in unison, and when men and
women or men and boys sang together, the men’s voices
sounded an octave lower than the women’s and the boy’s.
Some voices have naturally a high range and others low,
and no doubt in these plain chant melodies the singers who
could not reach all the tones comfortably, dropped unconsciously
to a lower pitch, and in that way, made a second
part. Soon the composers made this melody in the medium
range of the voice a part of their pieces instead of trusting
the singers to make it up as they went along. The principal
tune sung or carried by most of the singers was given the
name <em>tenor</em> (from the Latin <i><span lang="la">teneo</span></i>, to hold or carry). We
use the same word to indicate the man’s voice of high range.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hucbald and Organum</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Hucbald (840–930), a Flemish monk, first wrote a second
part, always a fifth above or a fourth below the tenor or
“subject.” (The Latin name for the subject is <i><span lang="la">cantus
firmus</span></i>—fixed song.) Hucbald probably used the fifth and
fourth because they were perfect intervals, and all others
except the octave, were imperfect. There were often four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>parts including the <i><span lang="la">cantus firmus</span></i>, for two parts were
doubled. This succession of fourths and fifths sounds very
crude and ugly (just try the example), but these people of
the Middle Ages must have liked it, for it lasted several
centuries and was an attempt at making chords. This
music was called <i><span lang="la">organum</span></i> or <em>diaphony</em> (dia-two, phony-sound:
two sounds). As early as 1100, singers tried out
new effects with the added parts and introduced a few
imperfect intervals, thirds and sixths, and tried singing
occasionally in contrary motion to the subject,—this was
called <i><span lang="la">discant</span></i> from a Greek word meaning discord. Maybe
at first it sounded discordant but soon it came to mean any
part outside of the <i><span lang="la">cantus firmus</span></i> or subject. (See musical
illustrations.)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>There was also a kind of diaphony in which a third voice
was written as a bass, a fifth below the <i><span lang="la">cantus firmus</span></i>, but it
was actually sung an octave higher than it was written and
sounded much better that way. As it was not a bass at
all it received the name of false bass or <em>faux bourdon</em>. This
was the beginning of chords such as we use.</p>

<p class='c008'>So, Hucbald started the science of harmony,—the study
of chords. Hucbald called this <i><span lang="la">ars organum</span></i>—the art of
organating or organizing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hucbald also invented a system of writing music on a
staff. It was not a staff such as we use today for he wrote
in the spaces the initials T and S. T meant that the singer
was to sing a whole tone, S, a semitone or half-step. He
used a six line staff and wrote words in script instead of
notes like this:</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Guido d’Arezzo and His Additions to Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The next great name in music history is Guido d’Arezzo,
a Benedictine monk (995–1050), famous for his valuable
additions to music.</p>

<p class='c008'>He invented the four-line staff, using both lines and spaces
and giving a definite place on the staff to each sound:</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c023'>Yellow line</td>
    <td class='c024'>C————————————</td>

    <td class='c023'>Black line</td>
    <td class='c024'>.............</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'>In the Middle Ages, the men did most of the singing so
the music was written in a range to suit their voices. C is
middle C, and F the bass clef.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>All music had to be written by hand and the monks
made wonderful parchment copies of works composed for
the church services. They soon grew careless about the
yellow lines and red lines, so Guido placed the letters C
and F at the beginning of the lines instead of using the
colored lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes there were three lines to a staff, sometimes
four, five, and even eleven! The use of clefs showing which
line was C or F, made reading of music much easier. At
the end of the 16th century the question of the number of
lines to the staff was definitely decided, then they used four
lines for the plain chant and five for all secular music.
By calling the fifth line of the eleven, middle C, two staffs
of five lines resulted—the grand staff of today.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is a table to show you how clefs grew:</p>

<div id='i_080'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i_080.jpg' alt='(from Vincent d’Indy’s “Cours de Composition Musicale”)' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Hucbald built his scales in groups of four tones like the
Greek tetrachords but Guido extended this tetrachord to a
hexachord or six-toned scale, and by overlapping the hexachords,
he built a series of scales to which he gave the name,
<em>gamut</em>, because it started on the G which is the first note
of our grand staff (lowest line, bass clef) and the Greek
word for G is “Gamma.”</p>

<p class='c026'>In the lowest hexachord, the B is natural, in the second
hexachord there is no B and in the third hexachord, the
B is flattened. Our sign (♭) for flat comes from the fact
that this B was called a round B and the sign (♮) for
natural was called a square B. The sharp (♯) came from
the natural and both meant at first raising the tone a half-step.</p>

<p class='c008'>Guido once heard the monks in the monastery of Arezzo
singing a hymn in honor of St. John the Baptist. He
noticed that each line of the Latin poem began on ascending
notes of the scale,—the first line on C, the second on
D, and so on up to the sixth on A. It gave him the
idea to call each degree of the hexachord by the first
syllable of the line of the Latin hymn, thus:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Here is a translation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Grant that the unworthy lips of Thy servant</div>
      <div class='line'>May be gifted with due harmony,</div>

      <div class='line'>Sing the praises of Thy wonders.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We still call our scale degrees <em>ut</em> (frequently changed to
<em>do</em>), <em>re</em>, <em>mi</em>, <em>fa</em>, <em>sol</em>, <em>la</em>. The French today use these syllables
instead of the letters of the alphabet, and Guido is
known as the man who originated this solmization (the
word taken from the syllables <em>sol</em> and <em>mi</em>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Where did the syllable <em>si</em>, the seventh degree of the scale,
come from? This hymn was written to St. John and in
Latin his name is <cite><span lang="la">Sancte Ioannes</span></cite>, the initials of which form
the syllable <em>si</em> which came into use long after Guido’s time.</p>

<p class='c008'>This system was very difficult for the singers to learn as
it was quite new to them, so Guido used his hand as a guide
to the singers. Each joint represented a different syllable
and tone, and a new scale began on every fourth tone.
Look at the Guidonian hand on the next page.</p>

<p class='c008'>Guido was so great a teacher and musician that he was
given credit for inventing much that already existed. He
gathered all the knowledge he could find into a book, that
was sent to the monasteries and music schools. He put in
much that never before had been written down, explained
many things that had never been clear, and added much
that was new and useful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes his name was written Gui or Guion. When
he lived people had no last names but were called by the
name of their native towns; as Guido was born in Arezzo, a
town of Tuscany, he was called Guido d’Arezzo; Leonardo
da Vinci, the great painter, was born in the village of Vinci;
and the great Italian composer Pierluigi da Palestrina came
from Palestrina.</p>

<p class='c008'>Guido’s work was considered revolutionary and not in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>accord with the old ways which the church fathers reverenced.
Because of plots against him, he was cast into
prison. But the Pope, realizing his greatness and value,
saved him. The inventors of new ideas always suffer!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mensural Music or Timed Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Before Guido invented it, there had been no system of
counting time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>If you are studying music, you know all about time signatures
and what metre a piece is in, from the ¾, ⁶⁄₈, ⁹⁄₈, ²⁄₄, ⁴⁄₄ or
sign Ⅽ at the beginning of the composition, but you probably
do not know how or when these signs came into use.
In the Gregorian plain song and in Organum, there was
practically no variety of rhythm and no need for showing
time or marking off the music into measures. The accents
fell quite naturally according to the words that were sung,
much as you would recite poetry. But as music grew up
and became more difficult, it was necessary for a chorus singing
in three or four different parts, to sing in time as well as
in tune, in order, at least, to start and finish together!</p>

<p class='c008'>The first metre that was used was triple (three beats to
the measure). It was called perfect and was indicated by
a perfect circle,
<img src='images/i_084a.jpg' alt='○' class="height3">,
the symbol of the Holy Trinity and
of perfection. Duple metre (two beats to the measure)
was imperfect and was indicated by an incomplete circle,
<img src='images/i_084b.jpg' alt='Ϲ' class="height3">.
Our sign for common time (four beats to the measure),
<img src='images/i_084c.jpg' alt='Ϲ' class="height3">
comes from this incomplete circle. ⁹⁄₈ was written
<img src='images/i_084d.jpg' alt='☉' class="height3">;
¾ was
<img src='images/i_084e.jpg' alt='○' class="height3">; ⁶⁄₈ was
<img src='images/i_084f.jpg' alt='Ͼ' class="height3">; and ⁴⁄₄ was
<img src='images/i_084g.jpg' alt='Ϲ' class="height3">.</p>

<p class='c008'>A monk named Franco, from Cologne, on the Rhine,
early in the twelfth century, invented these time signatures,
and notes which in themselves indicated different time
values. Hucbald’s neumes were no longer suited to the
new music, and besides time signatures it became necessary
to have a music language showing very clearly and definitely
the composer’s rhythm.</p>

<div id='i_084h'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_084h.jpg' alt='FRANCO’S NOTATION OUR NOTATION ▬ (maxima) = ⬭ (whole note) ▜ (longa) = ᑯ (half note) ◼ (brevis) = ♩ (quarter note) ◆ (semi-brevis) = ♪ (eighth note)' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Franco used four kinds of notes. Here they are translated
into the time values of today.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Organs</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In the 10th century, organs came into use in the churches,
but they were ungainly and crude, sounding only a few
tones, and were probably only used to keep the singers on
pitch. The organ had been invented long before this, and
had been used in Greece and Egypt. It was built on the
principle of Pan’s Pipes and was very simple. There were
many portable organs, called portatives, small enough to be
carried about.</p>

<p class='c008'>One organ (not a portative!) at Winchester, England, had
four hundred pipes and twenty-six pairs of bellows. It
took seventy men to pump air into it and two men to play
it by pounding on a key with their fists or elbows. The
tone was so loud that it could be heard all over the town.
Fancy that!</p>

<p class='c008'>During these centuries, music was growing slowly but
surely. Out of <i><span lang="la">organum</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">discant</span></i> and <em>faux bourdon</em>, arose
a style called counterpoint, in which three, four or more
melodies were sung at the same time. The writing of
<em>counterpoint</em>, or line over line, is like a basket weave for the
different melodies weave in and out like pieces of willow or
raffia forming the basket. Later will come the <em>chorale</em>,
written in chords or up and down music like a colonnade or
series of columns. Keep this picture in mind. (St.
Nicolas Tune, Chapter XI.) The word <em>point</em> means
<em>note</em> so <em>counterpoint</em> means <em>note against note</em>. The word was
first applied in the 13th century to very crude and discordant
part-writing. But, little by little the monks learned
how to combine melodies beautifully and harmoniously
and we still use many of their rules.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gradually great schools of church music flourished in
France, Germany, Spain, England, Italy and the Netherlands
in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Bit by bit this vast musical structure was built. It did
not grow quickly; each new idea took centuries to become
a part of music, and as often the idea was not good, it took
a long time to replace it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c016'>Troubadours and Minnesingers Brought Music to Kings and People</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Except for the first few chapters in this book, we have
told you of music made by men who wanted to improve
it. You have seen how the fathers of the Church
first reformed music, and gave it a shorthand called
neumes; before that, the music laws of the Egyptians, the
scales and modes of the Arab, the Greek scales which the
churchmen used in the Ambrosian and the Gregorian modes.
Then came the two-lined staff, and the beginnings of mensural
or measured music by which they kept time. Then
you saw how two melodies were fitted together and how they
grew into four parts. All this we might call “on purpose”
music. At the same time, in all the world, in every country,
there was Song&#160;... and never have the world and the
common people (called so because they are neither of the
nobility nor of the church) been without folk song which has
come from the folks of the world, the farmers, the weavers,
and the laborers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best of these songs have what the great composers
try to put into their music—a feeling of fresh free melody,
design, balance, and climax, but more of this in the chapter
on Folk Song.</p>

<p class='c008'>This chapter is to be about Troubadours, Trouvères, and
Minnesingers, who have left over two thousand songs. In
most of these, they made up both words and music, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>sometimes they used new words made up for folk tunes that
everyone knew, or for melodies from the plain-chants which
they had heard in church; sometimes they used the same
melody for several different poems, and often they set the
same words to several melodies. Many of these troubadour
songs and <em>minnelieder</em> became the people’s own folk songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now you must hear of the folk who lived hundreds of
years before these poet singers. Unknowingly, out of the
heart and soul and soil of their native lands, they made
songs and sang poetry and played sometimes other peoples’
song, scattering their own wherever they went.</p>

<p class='c008'>From these traveling singers and players, in all countries,
came the professional musicians who were minstrels, bards,
troubadours, etc., according to when, where and how they
lived.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Why of the Minstrel</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The people sang and played not only because they
wanted to, or because they loved it, but because they were
the newspaper and the radio of their time, singing the news
and doings of the day. These minstrels who traveled from
place to place “broadcasted” the events. No music was
written down and no words were fastened by writing to any
special piece. The singer would learn a tune and when he
sang a long story (an epic) he would repeat the tune many
times so it was necessary to find a pleasing melody, or
singers would not have been very welcome in the courts and
market places. These musical news columns entertained
the people who had few amusements. The wandering
minstrels with their harps or <i><span lang="cy">crwth</span></i> (Welsh harps), or
whatever instrument they might have used in their particular
country, were welcomed with open arms and hearts.</p>

<p class='c008'>This sounds as if these singers and players traveled, and
indeed they did! They sprang up from all parts of Europe
and had different names in different places. There were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>bards from Britain and Ireland, skalds from the Norse
lands, minstrels from “Merrie England,” troubadours from
the south of France, trouvères from the north of France,
jongleurs from both north and south who danced and
juggled for the joy of all who saw them, and minnesingers
and meistersingers in Germany.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Druids and Bards</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Centuries before this, Homer the great Greek poet was
called the Blind Bard and he chanted his poems, the <cite>Iliad</cite>
and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, to the accompaniment of the lyre, the
favorite instrument of the Greeks. But when we speak of
bards in this chapter we mean the poets and musicians of
ancient Britain, when that island was inhabited and ruled
by the Druids, 1000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> We do not know when the bards
first began to make music or when they were first called
bards, but it is certain that for many centuries before the
Christian era, these rude, barbarous people of the countries
we know as Wales, England, Ireland and Scotland, had
many songs, dances and musical instruments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Look at a map of France, and see how much like a teapot
it is shaped. The western part, the spout, is Brittany!
As its name shows, this part of France was inhabited by the
same race of people as were in Britain, they spoke the same
language, had the same religion and made the same music.
These people were Celts and their priests were called Druids.
Much we said about primitive people is true of these early
Britons. They expressed their feelings, and tried to protect
themselves from Nature and human foes by means of
religious rites and ceremonies in which music and dancing
played the leading part.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had no churches, but held religious services in the
open under the oak trees. They piled boulders on top of
each other to form altars, or built large circular enclosures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>of huge flat rocks, inside of which they gathered for worship,
or to assist at some ceremonial in which sacrifices of animals
and occasionally of human beings were made. These
human sacrifices occurred once a year at the Spring Festival
which was celebrated in much the same fashion as in Greece.
These masses of stone are found not only in the British
Isles, the most famous of which is Stonehenge (which was
recently bought by an American), but there are also many
of these so-called <em>cromlechs</em> and <em>menhirs</em> in Brittany.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is curious how often men and women do the same things
at times and places so completely separated that they could
not have been influenced by each other, but did what was
natural for them. It seems that between the state of being
primitive or savage and of being cultured, mankind must
pass through certain states of mind and certain bodily actions
common to all men. In tracing the growth of any
habits and actions of people,—in government, religion,
amusements, art, music, manners and customs, and language,
we find the same customs constantly repeated among
different races. If you remember this point, you will be
interested to watch, in this book, the difference between
these experiences common to all mankind and those which
later on, were caused by the influence that one race had on
another through meeting, through conquest and through
neighborly contact.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bards belonged to the priesthood and were Druids.
They sang in verse the brave deeds of their countrymen,
praises of the gods and heroes, and legends of war and adventure,
accompanying themselves on primitive harps, or
on an instrument something like the violin without a neck,
called a <i><span lang="cy">crwth</span></i>. They wore long robes and when they were
acting as priests, these were covered with white surplices
somewhat like the gowns of our own clergy. From a bit of
information handed down by the bards, we learn that in
Ireland, the graduate bard wore six colors in his robes, said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>to be the origin of the plaid of the Scotch Highlanders; the
king wore seven colors; lords and ladies, five; governors of
fortresses, four; officers and gentlemen, three; soldiers, two,
and the people were allowed to wear only one. Even their
dress seemed important and marked the rank!</p>

<p class='c008'>There were three kinds of bards: priestly bards who took
part in the religious rituals and were also the historians,
domestic bards who made music in honor of their masters,
and heraldic bards whose duties were to arouse patriotism
through songs in praise of their national heroes. They had
to pass examinations to become bards, and the lower
ranks were tested for knowledge and ability before being
promoted to the higher ranks. Recently there has been a
revival in Wales of the <i><span lang="cy">Eisteddfod</span></i>, or song contests of the
Druids.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Minstrelsy,” or singing to the <i><span lang="cy">crwth</span></i> or harp, lived on
long after Druidism had been replaced by the Christian
faith. Did you ever wonder where the custom came from
of mistletoe at Christmas time? Or of dancing around a
Maypole? Or building bonfires for May-day and St. John’s
eve? Celebrating All-Hallowe’en with pumpkins and black
cats? And of having Christmas trees? Well, these customs
are all relics of Druidism of 2000 or more years ago.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Skalds</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the land of the fierce Vikings or Norsemen, who inhabited
Scandinavia, Iceland and Finland before and during
the Middle Ages, there were bards called Skalds or Sagamen.
They recited and sang stories telling of their Norse
gods, goddesses and heroes, Woden, Thor, Odin, Freya,
Brynnhild, and of the abode of the gods, Walhalla. These
ballads formed the national epics called <em>sagas</em> and <em>eddas</em>,
from which Richard Wagner drew the story for his immortal
music dramas, the Nibelungenlied.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Odin, who was considered a Norse god, probably was a
Saxon prince who lived in the 3rd century, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> He revived
the Norse mythology and rites with the aid of minstrels,
seers, and priests. His teachings lasted until the
reign of Charlemagne, a devout Christian, who put an end
to pagan rites.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the 5th century came the Saxons, Hengist and Horsa,
descendants of Odin, and much of Britain fell under their
rule; with them, came the skalds whose duty it was to celebrate
the deeds of their lords. They appeared at the great
state banquets, and also on the battle fields, encouraging
the warriors with their songs of heroism, and comforting
the wounded soldiers.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Danes, the Angles and the Jutes came to
Britain in this same century, the country was called
England or Angle-land. Harpers and gleemen followed in
the footsteps of the Scandinavian skalds. These musician-singers
went as honored guests from court to court, and
received valuable presents. A popular gleeman was given
the title of poet-laureate, and crowned with a laurel wreath.</p>

<p class='c008'>The songs were taught orally and learned by heart, as
there was no notation at this early date (500 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>). They
accompanied themselves on small harps which could be
carried easily. The harp was handed around the banquet
table so that each guest in turn might sing a song as his
share of the entertainment. Singing and composing poetry
were a necessary part of a gentleman’s education.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “Venerable” Bede (Chapter VII) wrote that “Cædmon
the poet (600 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) never could compose any trivial or
vain songs, but only such as belonged to a serious and sacred
vein of thought&#160;... he was not practised in the art of
verse. So, oft, in an entertainment, where for the sake of
merriment it had been agreed that each in turn should sing
and harp, as the dreaded instrument was seen approaching,
he arose in shame from the supper table and went home to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>his house.” However, we learn that Cædmon who was a
serving man, had a vision in which an angel asked him to
“sing the beginning of creatures,” and when the vision had
passed, he remembered the heavenly song, and thus Cædmon
ceased to be shy, became the first great poet of England
and was permitted to be a monk.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the gleemen and harpers were not fighting men, they
had many privileges not granted to the warriors. They
passed, unchallenged, through the fighting camps, and we
have any number of stories of kings and warriors disguising
themselves as harpers in order to get information about
their enemies. A secret service system of the Middle Ages!</p>

<p class='c008'>In 878, Alfred the Great had been robbed of power and
authority by the Danes, so disguised as a gleeman and armed
only with a harp, he went into the Danish encampment.
The royal minstrel was received cordially, and while the
Danish king was listening to the songs, the harper (Alfred)
was getting the information he needed, and soon made a
surprise attack with his troops and was victorious. This
is spying with musical accompaniment!</p>

<p class='c008'>The Battle of Hastings (1066) caused great changes not
only in learning, customs, language, music, other arts and
politics, but in life itself. The French who, under William
of Normandy conquered Britain, were leaders in composing
poetry and song, and they brought over to Britain all their
talents. Now romance began and with it the art of glorifying
in song and verse, deeds of valor and the charms of
lovely ladies. And here the troubadours and trouvères
make their entrance into our story.</p>

<p class='c008'>France had had songs of deeds and action called <i><span lang="fr">Chansons
de Geste</span></i>, which were tales of the brave Charlemagne, celebrating
his victory over the invading Moors from Spain.
One of the greatest of these was the <cite><span lang="fr">Chanson de Roland</span></cite>.
Other songs or ballads on religious, historical, chivalric, or
political subjects took the place of our modern newspapers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and were powerful at the courts and among the people in
the towns. When a man in court circles did anything that
some one objected to, one of the minstrel-poets was hired
to make up a song about it, which was sung everywhere
until the news was well circulated, and the person punished,
often undeservedly. However it made the men of those
days think twice before doing things against the rights of
others, for they were really afraid of these songs that were
spread among their friends and enemies.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Battle of Hastings, Taillefer, a famous soldier-minstrel,
led the attack of the Normans, singing songs of
Roland and of Charlemagne. He struck the first blow in
the fight, and was the first one killed, but he went to his
death singing. Tales of our own soldiers in the great war
tell us the same about the need and love of music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Chanson de Roland</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The <cite><span lang="fr">Chanson de Roland</span></cite> is the national epic poem of
France, and dates back to this Norman period. It celebrates
the death at Roncevals, of Roland, Count of the
“Marsh” of Bretagne, in Charlemagne’s expedition against
Spain in 778. The work is divided into three parts. The
first tells of the fight between the French (Christians) and
the Saracens (Spanish Arabs), of the valor of Oliver and of
Roland, of the latter’s death, of Charlemagne’s miraculous
victory over the Saracens. The second part is a poem
not based on fact, in which Charlemagne fights Baligant,
the chief of all the pagans of the Orient; the western chief is
victorious over the pagan chief, who is utterly defeated and
killed. This poem pictures the victory of Christianity over
Paganism. In the third part, the revenge is carried further,
by Charlemagne’s taking the Saracen city Saragosse, and
bringing back with him to France another of the leaders,
Ganelon, who was tried and condemned to death.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>This is the leading French work of the Middle Ages, as it
sums up the greatest idealism, and brings to us that which
they considered most vital—the call of patriotism, of honor
and of duty.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Great Cathedrals and Feudal Castles</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>About this time began the building of the great Gothic
churches in France, England, and Germany. Rome had
fallen, paganism had gone, and the spirit of Christianity was
taking great hold of the people’s hearts. As a result of
this feeling to praise God suitably the great churches which
we copy even today were built.</p>

<p class='c008'>If “architecture is frozen music,” you can understand
why music and architecture developed at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was also the age of Feudalism, when the noblemen
lived in castles with moats and drawbridges, and owned
vast tracts of land and whole villages. People were retainers,
vassals and serfs, with no freedom and no property
rights except what the lords gave them. They even had
to give their masters much of the produce of the lands which
they cultivated. Of course, these feudal lords besides
having to be fed and guarded had to be entertained, and had
to know what was going on in the outside world. So, the
minstrels and bards were cordially welcomed, and wandered
from castle to castle, receiving presents of money or clothes,
jewelry, horses, and sometimes even houses.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>What Troubadours Learned Through Crusades</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Every year during the early centuries of the Christian
era, hundreds of pilgrims journeyed to the Holy Land undergoing
much hardship on the way. They thought through
this pilgrimage to be forgiven for their sins, and win the
approval of the Church, then far more powerful than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>kings. Toward the end of the 11th century, Mohammedans
had seized Palestine, and prevented the Christian pilgrims
from doing penance or worshipping at the Holy Sepulchre.
This led to a series of expeditions against the Mohammedans
in Palestine in which all the Christian countries of
Europe united. These expeditions were called the Crusades
(1095–1271), and they have been celebrated in story
and song ever since. The Crusades gave the rough uncultured
men of the Western world the chance to hear the
poetry and the songs of the Arabs (Chapter VI), who at
that time were the most advanced in culture and arts.
Although the Oriental music with its complicated rhythms
must have been hard to learn, the Crusaders brought back
much of real value and beauty,—a new way of singing, new
subjects for poems, and two new instruments, a kind of guitar
and <em>el oud</em>, in Europe called lute. The lute had a strong
influence on popular music, for it was the most commonly
used instrument for centuries.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Romance Languages</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Latin had been the language of France because the
Romans lived there so long, but later it became mixed with
the rough dialect and speech of the Franks and other
Gothic barbarous tribes and was much changed. From
this mixture came rustic Latin, or <cite><span lang="fr">Romanse rustique</span></cite>, and
modern French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese are still
called Romance languages. A new poetry was born in
Provence, the south of France, and in Normandy in the
north, written in this <cite><span lang="fr">Romanse rustique</span></cite>, and the oldest
French songs were called <em>lais</em>, lay or ballad. The great
ruler Charlemagne collected these <em>lais</em> of barbarian period
and the trouvères and troubadours had wonderful old
songs of heroism to choose from.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Provence they said “oc” for “yes” and in Normandy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“oui.” So, the language of the south of France
was called “langue d’oc” and of the north “langue d’oui.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Troubadours, Trouvères, Jongleurs</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The troubadours, whose very name brings to mind a
charming picture of romance, chivalry and adventure,
were the poet-composers of Provence a land of sunshine
where men were brave and courteous, and women beautiful
and gracious. The words <em>troubadour</em> and <i><span lang="fr">trouvères</span></i>, come
from <em>trobar</em>, <i><span lang="fr">trouver</span></i>, meaning to find or to invent, for these
troubadours and trouvères were the inventors or composers
of poems which they set to music.</p>

<p class='c008'>They wrote their songs on the four-lined staff in square
notes, without written accompaniment. The accompaniments
played on the lute, the guitar, the vielle, or sometimes
the harp, were probably made up by the <i><span lang="fr">jongleur</span></i>,
(<em>joglar</em>, <em>jouglar</em>, in English,—juggler) who sang the songs,
had trained bears, danced and played tricks. Then as
now there were composers and performers. The troubadours
and trouvères were as a rule, nobles and even
royalty. Five kings belonged to their number, the greatest
of them were Richard Cœur de Lion, William Count of
Poitiers, Alfonso, Thibaut de Champagne, and King of
Navarre.</p>

<p class='c008'>The troubadour seldom sang his own songs, as this was
the jongleur’s duty. There were many more jongleurs
than troubadours, and they belonged to a much lower
grade of society. The jongleurs traveled from place to
place, from castle to castle, with their instruments slung
across their backs, and their songs in a little bag at their
side. They were heartily welcomed wherever they went,
but if they found the doors of the castles closed to them,
they soon gathered a crowd in the public squares, where
they performed to the joy of the townspeople.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Can you imagine the pleasure these strolling entertainers
gave to the people who did not have motors, movies,
radios, gramophones and theatres for their amusement?
How happy the custodian of the castle must have been
when he looked across the moat and lowered the drawbridge
for the welcome minstrels!</p>

<p class='c008'>The jongleurs grew so numerous, and their music became
so poor that they were nuisances, little better than
outlaws and beggars. How easily a good thing can be
overdone!</p>

<p class='c008'>In the 14th century they banded together in perhaps
the first musical union on record. They appointed leaders,
called kings of the minstrels or jugglers. At first they
were hired by nobles and troubadours as entertainers with
the rank of servants. Even the monasteries received them
with joy during the early days; later they were denounced
by the Church, and forbidden to enter the monasteries, for
they had sung of evil things instead of lovely things and
had acted unseemly. During Lent, they were forbidden to
appear in public, so they wisely used that time to go to
schools of minstrelsy, where they learned new songs, and
tried their skill at composing. In these schools they were
also taught to play their instruments. Sometimes we hear
of women minstrels, who sang, played the flute, danced,
and performed tricks to the endless delight of the
audience. (See lining of the cover of this book.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The jongleurs, at their best, seem to have “gotten in”
everywhere,—at the courts of kings, in all the tournaments,
festivals, pilgrimages, and weddings. A wedding wasn’t
complete without them! At the knightly tournaments
and jousts, the minstrel was a most necessary person,
for, did he not take the place of newspapers, and give accounts
to a waiting world of the results of the exciting
tournaments?</p>

<p class='c008'>Massenet, the French composer, wrote a lovely opera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>called <cite>The Juggler of Notre Dame</cite>, from one of the old
miracle tales of a young juggler sheltered by the monks of
Notre Dame. Everyone brought rich gifts to place at the
feet of the Virgin Mary, but being a pauper, he had nothing
but his songs, dances and tricks, which he offered the Virgin
by going through them as best he could in front of the
shrine. So shocked were the monks by his seeming lack of
respect, that they wanted to drive him out! At this moment
the miracle took place. The image of the Virgin
came to life and stretched forth her arms protectingly to
the young juggler, showing that she accepted his offering
given in all sincerity and simplicity.</p>

<p class='c008'>As all the countries of Europe took part in the Crusades,
the troubadours’ songs were heard by others than the
French, and their music spread rapidly. Richard, the
Lion-Hearted, King of England, was a famous Crusader
and a troubadour of skill. He invited jongleurs over from
France, one of whom, Blondel de Nesle, became his devoted
companion during the Crusade of 1193, and saved
Richard’s life. Richard was taken captive by Leopold,
Duke of Austria, and was cast into a dungeon. The English
did not know where to look for their monarch, but
Blondel undertook the search, going from place to place,
singing songs which he and the king had written together.
One day as he sang, from the tower of a castle came a voice
which he recognized as Richard’s, singing the same song!
And soon the royal troubadour was released.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Troubadours</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>This new art of poetry and song was called “The gay
science of chivalry and love-service.” Indeed many of the
poems about knightly adventure were addressed to some
fair lady, real or imaginary, known or unknown. Curious
as it may seem, the names of most of these songs came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>from the Arabian, because the Europeans met them during
the crusades and during the Arabs’ conquests and roamings
in Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The names tell you what the songs were about. <i><span lang="fr">Chanson</span></i>
and <em>canzo</em> both mean song, and we see these names today
on our concert programs. There were story telling
songs called the <i><span lang="fr">chansons de toile</span></i>, songs of linen, which
told of the lovely damsels at work weaving, of their beauty,
and of their thoughts, for the women of castle and cottage
alike wove the cloth out of which the clothes were made.
Then, they had dramatic songs and dancing songs called
<i><span lang="es">estampies</span></i> (from which comes our word stamping); the
<em>reverdies</em>, or spring songs, to celebrate the Spring festivals;
the <em>pastorelles</em> in which the heroine was always a charming
shepherdess; the <i><span lang="fr">sera</span></i> or <em>serenade</em>, an evening song; the
<em>nocturne</em>, a night song, and love songs were often sung under
the beloved ladies’ windows! The <em>alba</em> was a morning
song. The <em>sirvantes</em>, or songs of service, sung in praise of
princes or nobles, or telling of public happenings were important.
These were often accompanied by drums, bells,
pipes and trumpets.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have debating societies in our schools and colleges,
and questions of the day are discussed in the newspapers,
but in the troubadours’ day, debates were made into songs,
sung by two people, and were called <em>tensons</em>. Many curious
and rather foolish questions were made the subjects of
these songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes these popular songs found their way into the
Church, and were made into fine church music, and sometimes
a bit of melody from the Church went through the
hands of a troubadour poet and was turned into a <em>rounde</em>,
<i><span lang="it">ballata</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">sera</span></i>, or <i><span lang="it">pastorella</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>This poetry and song of Provence lasted until the middle
of the 14th century, for in the twelve hundreds the revolts
against the abuses of the Church rose to such seriousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>that massacres took place, towns were destroyed and many
nobles and troubadours lost their lives.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Trouvères</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Shortly after the troubadours began to compose, in
the north of France came the trouvères who profited
much from the music and poetry of their southern
brothers.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, the trouvères did not have the warm, lovely
dialect of the southern troubadours. As they were closer
to the Church, their songs were more religious, had less
variety of subjects, and the melodies were like Church
music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the troubadours did much to shape the rhyming
stanzas in poetry, the trouvères helped in the gradual
forming of the later French and Flemish schools of music,
as you will see.</p>

<p class='c008'>The jongleurs played on an instrument called the <em>vielee</em>
which was great-grandfather to our violin. The short
pieces played before the songs and accompanied by dances,
were the first pieces of instrumental music in the Middle
Ages. The combination of song, instrument and dance
was called <em>balerie</em> or <i><span lang="es">ballada</span></i> from which comes our dance
<em>ballet</em>. There was also a piece called <em>rounde</em>, <em>rota</em>, or <i><span lang="it">rondo</span></i>,
composed so that different voices and the instrument came
in at different points, each singing or playing the same
tune, but arranged so that the parts sounded well together.
Perhaps you know <cite><span lang="fr">Frère Jacques</span></cite> or <cite>Scotland’s Burning</cite> or
<cite>Three Blind Mice</cite>. These are rounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most beautiful rounds in existence is an English
song which dates from 1250, the period of all this “gay
science,” and it is looked upon as a masterpiece. It is
supposed to have been written either by John Forsete, a
monk, or by Walter Odington. It was written in the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>square neumes on a six line staff. The name of this “Six
Men’s Song” or round for six voices, is <cite>Summer is icumen
In</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the best known trouvères was Adam de la Hale
who wrote <cite><span lang="fr">Robin et Marion</span></cite>, said to be the very first comic
opera. It was performed at the court of Naples in 1285.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trouvères collected tales of Normandy, Brittany,
and of Charlemagne’s reign, and so preserved valuable
musical and literary material.</p>

<p class='c008'>So these troubadours and trouvères made the age of
Chivalry romantic and beautiful to us who came long after
them, in spite of much unpleasantness, prejudice, war,
massacre and hardship.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Minnesingers</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Along the river Rhine in Germany near that part of
France where the trouvères sang, lived the Minnesingers.
They sang love songs,—<em>minne</em> was the old German word
for love. Like the troubadours the minnesingers were
of the nobility, but they rarely hired jongleurs or anybody
to perform their songs; they sang them themselves, playing
their own accompaniments on lutes or viels (viols).</p>

<p class='c008'>Many songs expressed adoration of the Virgin, and
others praised deeds of chivalry. Differing from other
minstrels, they made songs about Nature and Religion full
of feeling, fancy and humor, but the minnesongs were not
so light-hearted or fanciful as those of their French neighbors.
They had marked rhythm, beauty of form and simplicity,
and were more dramatic, telling the exploits of the
Norse heroes in many a glorious story.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their story was far more important to them than the
music which for a long time was like the stern plain song
of the Church. “We should be glad they were what they
were, for they seem to have paved the way for the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Protestant music of the 16th century,” says Waldo Selden
Pratt in his <cite>History of Music</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>You can get an excellent idea of the minnesong in
Wolfram von Eschenbach’s <cite>Oh Thou Sublime Sweet Evening
Star</cite>, which Wagner wrote in the spirit of the ancient
minnesingers in the opera <cite>Tannhäuser</cite>. Tannhäuser was a
real minnesinger, taking part in a real song contest, held by
the Landgraf (Count) of Thuringia, 1206–7, who offered
his daughter Elizabeth’s hand to the winner, whatever his
rank. We find Elizabeth also in Wagner’s <cite>Tannhäuser</cite>,
so when you hear it you will know that it is history as well
as beautiful music! How remarkable that, in the days of
feudalism, when the nobles practically owned the so-called
common people, talent for music and verse stood even
above rank! After all there is no nobility like that of
talent. Even in the 13th century this was understood, and
to either commoner or peer winning the song tournament,
the lady of rank was given in marriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wolfram von Eschenbach, the minnesinger, visited the
courts and sang in many tournaments. Giving Wagner
a character for the opera <cite>Tannhäuser</cite> was not all he did as
Eschenbach wrote a poem from which Wagner drew the
story for his <cite>Parsifal</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Walther von der Vogelweide, one of the most famous
minnesingers, was so fond of birds, that when dying he
asked for food and drink to be placed on his tomb every
day for the birds. There are four holes carved in the
tombstone; and pilgrims today, when they visit this singer’s
grave, still scatter crumbs for them, who probably in their
bird histories record that Walther loved song even as they!</p>

<p class='c008'>Prince Conrad, Konradin he was called, son of the last
Swabian King, was the last famous minnesinger. Everyone
battled for other people’s countries and lands then, and so
Conrad, heir to the crown, joined a Sicilian rebellion against
France, and was killed by a troubadour, the Duke of Anjou.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mastersingers</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>After poor Conrad’s time, the art of minnesinging declined,
but as people must have music, a new activity
sprang up among the people or “folk” instead of among
the gentry and knights. The folk who took part in this
were called the Meistersingers or mastersingers and their
story is very thrilling and picturesque.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the day of the Robber Baron, when Germany
was broken up into little kingdoms and principalities.
Any rich and powerful noble could start a war to steal
away the rights of another ruler, and become ruler himself.
This was no pleasant state of affairs for the people, for
they were in constant terror of death, of the destruction of
their crops, or new taxes. Life became so perilous that
people left the farms and went to the cities for protection.
The feudal system began to fail, for the people would no
longer be slaves, and gradually took up trades and formed
themselves into guilds. The warring nobles had neglected
music for conquest, so these workers and artisans, hungry
for it, formed music guilds as well as trade guilds, drew up
rules for making music and poetry, and held prize competitions.
In these music guilds there were six grades of
membership: first, member; second, scholar or apprentice;
then, friends of the school; singer, poet, and finally mastersinger
or <cite><span lang="de">Meistersinger</span></cite>. You can get a real picture of
their day in the greatest comic opera ever written, Wagner’s
<cite><span lang="de">Die Meistersinger</span></cite>, and you can make the acquaintance of
Hans Sachs, the most famous Meistersinger (1494–1576).</p>

<p class='c008'>Heinrich von Meissen, known as <i><span lang="de">Frauenlob</span></i> (Praise of
Women), is said to have founded the Meistersinger movement
over a hundred years before Hans Sachs’ time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Til Eulenspiegel, whose merry pranks have been delightfully
told in music by Richard Strauss, a present
day composer, was also a Meistersinger.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The origin of the name “Meistersinger” is disputed.
One historian tells us that it was given to every minnesinger
who was not a noble,—in other words, a burgher-minstrel.
The other historian claims that the title <cite>Meister</cite>
or master was given to any one who excelled in any act or
trade, and afterwards came to mean all the guild members.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the 14th century to the 16th, hardly a town in
Germany was without music guilds and Meistersingers.
Although they lost power then, the last guilds did not disappear
until 1830, and the last member died in 1876. They
must have passed the long winter evenings pleasantly for
they met, and read or sang poems of the minnesingers or
new ones composed by the members themselves. These
guilds must have been great fun, for they had badges and
initiation ceremonies and the kind of celebrations one loves
in a club.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had complicated, narrow-minded rules called
<cite>Tablatur</cite> which today seem quite ridiculous, so much has
music matured and thrown off the chains which once
bound it!</p>

<p class='c008'>When the guilds grew too large to be held in the different
homes, the churches became the meeting places for practise
and for the contests.</p>

<p class='c008'>The highest praise we can give the Meistersingers is that
they carried the love of music and song into every German
home and made it a pastime of domestic life. Their influence
spread not only through Germany, but throughout
all lands. The composers who followed were glad to have
their songs from which to draw inspiration for the popular
religious songs at the time of the Protestant Reformation.
Even though they did not make up any very great words or
music, they spread a love for it and made people feel that
the following of music as a career was worthy and dignified.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is interesting to know before we close this chapter,
that the English, well into the 16th century, after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>passing of the troubadours, trouvères, minnesingers and
mastersingers, still celebrated the exploits of the day in
ballads called the Percy Reliques.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Vielle or Hurdy-Gurdy</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>If you had lived in the Middle Ages you would have seen
the strolling players traveling around with a queer looking
instrument known by many different names,—<i><span lang="fr">vielle</span></i>,
<em>organistrum</em>, <em>Bauernleier</em> (peasant lyre), <em>Bettlerleier</em> (beggar’s
lyre) or <em>hurdy-gurdy</em>. This was a country instrument, not
often seen in cities, and was shaped like the body of a lute
without a long neck. It had wire strings, sometimes gut,
and a set of keys; the sound was made by turning a little
crank at the bottom. The <i><span lang="fr">vielle</span></i> or <em>hurdy-gurdy</em> is a cross
between the bowed and the keyed instruments. In the
12th century it was called the <em>organistrum</em>, a large instrument
which took two men to play. It flourished in the
18th century throughout Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so, now on to folk songs, although we would like to
linger in this romantic period of wandering minstrels.</p>

<div>

</div>
<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>Folk Music</span><br> <span class='sc'>All the World Has Danced and Sung</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We have watched the human race grow out of its state
of primitive yells and grunts, or babyhood, telling
its stories and expressing its feelings in crude music. We
have seen it sing and dance its way through the ages during
which its men were semi-barbarians, like the Franks, Gauls,
Goths, Huns, Saxons, Celts, and Angles into the period
when these same tribes became the French, German, Belgian
and English nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Music was not a thing of learning as it is today, it was
merely a way of talking, of enjoying life, and of passing on
to others deeds and doings of the time. Early people said
in poetry and song what was in their hearts. They knew
nothing of musical rules and regulations and passed their
songs along from father to son through the long years when
the world was young, and their best songs have in them the
seed of musical art! A modern Greek folk singer said:
“As I don’t know how to read, I have made this story into
a song, so as not to forget it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This music of the people, by the people and for the
people is Folk Music and we shall see how these simple,
tuneful bits have influenced the world of music because, as
H. E. Krehbiel said, “they are the heartbeats of the&#160;...
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>folk and in them are preserved feelings, beliefs and habits
of vast antiquity.” Don’t you believe that studying history
through folk tunes would be fascinating? People today
have found out much about the different races and
tribal events through them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible to find out who wrote the five thousand
folk songs of England and the more than five thousand of
Russia and of Ireland and all the others, for it was not until
the 19th century that folk songs and dances became a serious
study. The fact is, that a true folk song doesn’t want
to find its composer for it loses its rank as a folk song if its
maker should turn up! Isn’t that curious? But it is not
quite fair, for surely we should accept as folk songs those
which have sprung up among them, or have become a part
of their lives through expressing their thoughts and feelings,
even though the composer’s name has not been lost. We
divide folk songs into two classes,—Class A, the composerless
songs, and Class B, those tagged with a name.</p>

<p class='c008'>Isn’t it exciting to think that folk songs and dances of
the ancient Greeks, the Aztecs of Peru, the Chinese, the
Irish and Russian peasants and our American negroes have
things in common? It seems as if they might have had a
world congress in primitive times and agreed on certain
kinds of songs, for every nation has</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>So it comes to pass, that many a time when nations, due
to wars and wanderings and vast passings of time, have
forgotten their origins, the singing of a song will bring back
the fact of some far distant relationship.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day a party of Bretons, in 1758 (long after the
Welsh and Bretons had forgotten they were of the same
race), were marching to give battle to some Welsh troops
that had descended upon the French coast. As the Welsh
soldiers marched forward, the Bretons were amazed to hear
their enemies singing one of their own national songs!
They were so surprised and so overcome with sympathy
that the Bretons joined in and sang with the Welsh. Both
commanders, speaking the same language, gave the order
“Fire!” But neither side would or could fire. Instead,
the soldiers dropped their weapons, broke ranks and in wild
enthusiasm greeted each other as long lost friends. The
song they sang is probably seven hundred years old or
older.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(1) <span class='sc'>Songs of Childhood, Games and Cradle Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>From the day of the obelisk to the day of the radio,
every baby that has ever been born has been put to sleep
to the soothing sound of the mother’s song. The Greek
mother sang to her baby,</p>

<p class='c008'>Many early lullabies were sung in honor of the infant

It is related by a Sicilian poet “When the Madunazza

(Bambino—the Infant Jesus) cried in his cradle,
because no one was attending to Him. So the Archangel
Raphael came and rocked Him and said these sweet little
words to Him, ‘Lullaby, Jesus, Son of Mary.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Indians, too, sang lullabies, for you know the squaw
is a gentle soul and takes beautiful care of her papoose.
The Chippewas think of sleep as a big insect and they
have named him Weeng. Weeng comes down from the
top of a tree where he is busy making a buzzing noise with
his wings and puts you to sleep by sending many little

<p class='c018'>We all have sung <cite>The Farmer in the Dell</cite>, <cite>London Bridge
is Falling Down</cite>, <cite>Ring Around the Rosy</cite> and many other
game-songs. We have told you of the Indian moccasin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>game, and we know that in all the other nations the children
have had their game-songs.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(2) <span class='sc'>Songs for Religious Ceremonies, Holidays, and Christmas Carols, etc., May Songs and Spring Festivals</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Spring is so full of the beginnings of life, and people can
see the flowers begin to bloom and take on color and glory.
Even as you and I, they have never been able to see them
without rejoicing and every one’s rejoicing sooner or later is
a cause for music. In many countries this renewal of life
is celebrated by rites and ceremonies that have been the
source of much folk-lore and music.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Greeks, as early as the 6th Century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, celebrated
the coming of the spring with a religious festival named
after the god Dionysus. Many songs and dances accompanied
these festivals. On the evening before the festival,
which lasted five days, there was an impressive procession
by torch-light in which an image of the god Dionysus was
carried to the theatre where the festival was held, accompanied
by many handsome youths and a very splendid bull
which was sacrificed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the excavations of Crete this ancient hymn has been
found,—a spring song and a young man-song in one:</p>

<p class='c005'>Ho! Kouros (young man), most Great, I give thee hail, Lord of all
that is wet and gleaming; thou art come at the head of thy Daemones.
To Dickte for the year, Oh, march and rejoice in the dance and song.</p>

<p class='c028'>In Germany, it was thought that on Walpurgis-nacht
(May night) witches rode on the tails of magpies and
danced away the winter snows on the Brocken, one of the
highest peaks of the Hartz Mountains. In Germany too,
it was the custom for children to set May-flies (Maikäfer)
free and to sing this song:</p>

<p class='c008'>The first comic opera, a <em>pastourale</em> six hundred years
old, <cite><span lang="fr">Le Jeu de Robin et de Marion</span></cite> by Adam de la Hale,
is full of May songs.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>The King and Queen of the May and May Pole dancers
and the English Jack-in-the-Green, the Thuringian Little
Leaf Man and the Russian tree dressed up are only a few
of the many examples of the rites of spring. And we have
seen how the Druids and the Aztecs celebrated spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most modern composers, Igor Stravinsky, has
written a ballet called <cite><span lang="fr">Le Sacre du Printemps</span></cite> (Rites of
Spring) in which he has used the ancient Russian pagan
rites of celebrating the spring. The music is wild and the
rhythms primitive.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Religious Ceremonies</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>From legends, we know that songs and dances of the
Polish people accompanied their religious ceremonies before
Christianity. When they exchanged their pagan gods
for the teachings of the early Christian fathers, many of
these songs were lost, but some of them were handed down
merely by changing the pagan name to the Christian.
These songs have been traced by the fact that many of
them are based on the old pentatonic scale. The Slavs,
the Lithuanians and the Germanic races have kept this
scale in Eastern and Middle Europe, and the Greeks, the
ancient Italians and the Celts brought it into Western and
Southern Europe. These scales are supposed to have
come from Indo-China, for it must not be forgotten that
the Polish along with all Slavs migrated from Asia, the
cradle of the human race.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two festivals,—St. John’s Eve and Christmas, came
down from the pagan era in Poland and the manner of celebration
has changed little throughout the centuries.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Christmas Carols</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Polish Christmas Carol was also handed down from
the days before Christ. The word “carol” comes from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>old French <em>carole</em> which was a dance, and gave its name to
the song by which it was accompanied. In the pagan time
there were summer carols, winter carols, Easter carols and
carols that celebrated a religious winter festival. As the
winter festival occurred about the same time of the year as
the Nativity or birthday of the Saviour, it was celebrated
in the Christian Church as Christmas. In England, the
old Yule-tide of the Druids has influenced the present celebration
of Christmas with its fun, festivities and Christmas
trees!</p>

<p class='c008'>Throughout Germany, Christmas Carols are still sung
early every Christmas morning, and many of the old hymns
have thus been preserved.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Christmas Carol in France is called <cite><span lang="fr">Noël</span></cite> and the old
English word was <em>Nowell</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(3) <span class='sc'>Love Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is safe to say that there are more love songs than any
other kind of folk music, and among them is some of the
most beautiful music in the world. You will find charming
folk love songs of every nationality on earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Different countries have different marriage customs
which give an intimate picture of the life in different
periods, of countries and tribes far apart. Again we can
trace forgotten relationships in like customs of bygone
days. Singing and dancing are very important in all marriage
celebrations, and some wedding music is of great age.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Russia, for example, the marriage customs and wedding
music are very beautiful and impressive. At the
same time no folk dancing is wilder or gayer than that
celebrating a peasant marriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before going to a wedding ceremony, the Polish bride
sings one particular song built on the pentatonic scale, that
has probably been sung for more than two thousand years!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>There are other wedding ceremony songs that can be traced
back almost as far.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Brittany, during the 11th and 12th centuries, the
priest demanded a “nuptial song” from the newly-weds on
the Sunday following the wedding, as a wedding tax!</p>

<p class='c008'>In another place the feudal lord demanded that every
new bride should dance and sing before him and in return
he decorated her with a bonnet of flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>You haven’t forgotten the Indian and his love music
played on the flute, have you?</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(4) <span class='sc'>Patriotic Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the recent World War, we had examples of how folk
songs were made. There were popular songs like <cite>Over
There</cite> (George Cohan), <cite>The Long, Long Trail</cite> (by Zo Elliot),
<cite>Tipperary</cite>, <cite>Madelon</cite>, that were sung by millions. They
were songs of the people, by the people and for the people,
and no one cared who wrote them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the national hymns and patriotic songs were
born in a time of storm and stress. Words inspired by
some special happening were written on the spur of the moment,
and often set to some familiar tune. <cite>America</cite> was
first sung to the tune of <cite>God Save the King</cite> on July 4, 1832.
The words of <cite>Star Spangled Banner</cite> were written by Francis
Scott Key during the War of 1812 as he watched the bombardment
of Fort McHenry in Chesapeake Bay, and was
set to an English drinking song, <cite>Anacreon in Heaven</cite>.
<cite>Yankee Doodle</cite>, a song first sung to make fun of the young
colonists, became the patriotic hymn of the Revolution!
Where the tune came from is a mystery, but it shows a
family likeness to a little Dutch nursery song, a German
street song, an old English country dance, a folk tune from
the Pyrenees and one from Hungary! But we love our
old <cite>Yankee Doodle</cite> anyhow! <cite>Hail Columbia</cite> was adapted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>to a tune, <cite>The President’s March</cite>, which had accompanied
Washington when he was inaugurated, in New York, as
our first president.</p>

<p class='c008'>England’s <cite>God Save the King</cite> was composed, words and
music, by Henry Carey, and it was used first in 1743 during
the Jacobite uprising. It has since served America, Germany,
Denmark and Switzerland. <cite>Auld Lang Syne</cite> of
Scotland was written by “Bobby” Burns and set to an old
Scotch tune. <cite>St. Patrick’s Day</cite> was originally a jig, and
<cite>The Wearing of the Green</cite> was a street ballad of the Irish rebellion
of 1798 mourning the fact that the Irish were forbidden
to wear their national emblem, the shamrock. The
Welsh song <cite>Men of Harlech</cite>, a stirring tune, dates from 1468.</p>

<p class='c008'>The French have several thrilling national songs. If
you heard <cite><span lang="fr">Malbrouk s’en va-t-en guerre</span></cite> (Malbrouk to war is
going) you would say, “Why! that’s <cite>For He’s a Jolly Good
Fellow</cite>.” So it is, and it has had a long and chequered
career. It is supposed to have been brought into Europe
by one of the Crusaders, and was lost for five centuries; it
cropped up again in 1781 when Marie Antoinette sang it to
put the little Dauphin (the French prince) to sleep. Paris
picked up the tune and it was heard in every café and on
every street corner. Napoleon who had no ear for music
hummed it. It crossed the English channel. Even the
Arabs sing a popular song like it which they call <cite>Mabrooka</cite>.
Beethoven used the air in a Battle Symphony (1813).</p>

<p class='c008'>The stirring hymn of France, is the <cite>Marseillaise</cite> written
by Rouget de l’Isle (1792) on the eve of the Revolution.
It became the marching song of the French Army and was
sung during the attack on the Tuileries (Paris), the king’s
palace. It has always been the Republican song of France.</p>

<p class='c008'>In almost every book you read about the French Revolution,
<cite><span lang="fr">La Carmagnole</span></cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">Ça Ira</span></cite> are mentioned. They accompanied
thousands of victims to the guillotine. <cite><span lang="fr">Ça Ira</span></cite>
(It will go!) was a popular dance which Marie Antoinette
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>played on her <i><span lang="fr">clavecin</span></i>. Little did she know that the same
tune would be shouted by the infuriated mobs as she was
driven through the streets of Paris in the tumbril to the
guillotine!</p>

<p class='c008'>The Italians show their natural love for opera by the fact
that their national hymn is adopted from Bellini’s opera
<cite><span lang="la">Somnambula</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <cite>Rakoczy March</cite> of which you will hear later in the
chapter is the Hungarian national hymn.</p>

<p class='c008'>We could write an entire book on this subject, but this is
only to give you a suggestion of how these songs grew and
where they came from.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(5) <span class='sc'>Songs of Work and Labor and Trades</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We have shown you the American Indians singing their
songs as they fish and pound the corn; the boatmen rowing
to the rhythm of their songs; and we have tried to show you
that everybody loved songs as much when they worked as
when they danced. Haven’t you, too, hummed or sung
while working? People who accompany dish cloths and
dusters with songs work better!</p>

<p class='c008'>American negroes have used song to ease their work in
the hot sunny fields. They not only sang, but men were
hired to sing and act as song leaders in the slave days, to
set the pace for workers, for more work was done when the
slaves moved to the rhythm of music. In modern factories
today, music is used to relieve the drudgery.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Southern States the stevedores sing as they unload and
load ships. And haven’t you often heard a rhythmic sound
uttered by men hauling ropes on ships or buildings?</p>

<p class='c008'>The world over, sailors have their songs and dances,
farmers their reaping and planting songs, spinners and
weavers their songs, boatmen songs like those on the Nile
and the Volga boat song.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>While few Greek folk songs have come down to our
time, we know that they had songs for reaping the
harvest, for grinding the barley, for threshing the wheat,
for pressing the grapes, for spinning wool, and for weaving.
They also had the songs of the shoemaker, the dyer, of the
bath-master, the water carrier, of the shepherd, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are innumerable spinning songs of all nationalities,
and shepherds’ songs,—you probably know the French
<cite><span lang="fr">Il etait une Bergère</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Africa, we hear that the workers when cleaning rice
were led by singers, who clapped their hands and stamped
their feet to accompany the song. One man reports that
he heard the negro women singing a national song in
chorus, while pounding wheat always in time with the
music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charles Peabody tells of a leader in a band of slaves in
America who was besought by his companions not to sing
a certain song because it made them work too hard!</p>

<p class='c008'>The difference between the negro songs and the labor
songs of other peoples and places is, that the negroes had no
special labor songs but sang their religious songs, which
they adapted to all purposes and occasions, while the true
labor song was composed to fit the occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>In old England we hear of the “Labor-lilts” which were
all work songs of spinners, milk-maids and shepherds.
And we must not neglect the old night-watchman whom we
meet in Wagner’s <cite><span lang="de">Die Meistersinger</span></cite>. Neither can we let
go by unnoticed the “town-crier” who told the news, good
and bad. The street calls and cries of the Middle Ages
were labor songs, later, in England and in France made
into real compositions.</p>

<p class='c008'>We, in America, have the old Cow-boy songs, the Mining
songs of California, and the Lumberjack songs of Maine.
These are not exactly labor songs but are first cousins to
them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>The stage coach <em>postillons</em> with their fascinating horn
calls are really music of trades or occupations, too. Isn’t it
too bad that the inartistic jangle of the tram-car and the
“honk-honk” of the automobile tear our ears instead of the
tuneful hunting horns and postillon horns which are still
occasionally heard in European forests!</p>

<p class='c008'>The world’s workers sing to make work slip along easily,
so you see song is a great lubricant.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(6) <span class='sc'>Drinking Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the great dining halls of the Middle Ages, when hunting
parties gathered, and guests were received from near
and far, or at Christmas time, when in old Britain the
Wassail-bowl flowed freely, drinking songs were an important
part of the banquet. At the splendid feasts in
Rome, drinking songs were popular. In fact, all over the
world there are thousands of this kind of folk song.</p>

<p class='c008'>The name Wassail dates back to the day when Vortigern,
King of the Britons, visited Hengist, the Saxon.
Rowena, Hengist’s daughter greeted him with, “Was
hail hla, ond cyning!” which mean in plain English, “Be
of health, Lord King!” to which the king replied, “Drink
heil” (Drink health).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Word Vaudeville</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the second half of the 15th century, two men
named Basselin and Jean de Houx wrote many drinking
songs. As they lived in the little valleys (in French called
<em>vaux</em>) near Vire in Normandy, drinking songs came to be
called <i><span lang="fr">vaux-de-vire</span></i>. At the same time, songs that were
sung in the streets, in fact, any folk songs with gay melodies
and light words, were called <i><span lang="fr">voix-de-ville</span></i>, (or voices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of the city). So, in some way, these two terms became
mixed, and the familiar word, <em>vaudeville</em> is the result!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(7) <span class='sc'>Dancing Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the folk dance, man shows the feelings and dispositions
of his race. From this dance of the people, all music
gradually took a measured form, a rhythmic thing that is
lacking in the song of primitive people. In primitive
times, all dances were sung, particularly was this the case
with the Slav race. As instruments were perfected, they
took the place of primitive drums and singing as accompaniment
to the dance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plain chant, and in fact all music of the church,
lacked the element we call rhythm. It followed a metre or
measure needed by the words, but this was much more like
talking than like singing. Even the ornamented chant of the
soloists in the churches had no definiteness of time or of phrase.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rhythm as we feel it today, occurs in two ways,—through
the singing of verses and through dancing. We
must not forget that early peoples were much like children,
and took pleasure in jingles, and in moving their feet and
bodies in repeated motions which became dances.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is most fascinating to see that the people who have
the saddest songs, have the gayest and wildest dances!
Maybe it is because the sadder the nation the more need it
has for some gay way of forgetting its woes. The Russians,
the Poles, the Norwegians and the people of all
north countries where the songs are minor and tragic, have
the wildest dances. The clothes, too, of the folk in these
countries are decked in colored embroideries, and the
decorations of the houses giddy and jolly. When the Russians
get together they forget their sorrows in wild and
almost frenzied dances, and directly after they will sing
songs of deepest gloom.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Polish Dances</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The Poles have several folk dances that are easily recognized
by their rhythm and style. The great Polish composer
Chopin used these folk dances in some of the loveliest
piano music ever written. For more than six centuries
they have been used by Polish composers, yet there are people
who say that folk song has no influence on musical art.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Polonaise, in ¾ time, a stately dance of the aristocracy
and nobles rather than of the people, began as a
folk dance, and is supposed to have come from the Christmas
Carol. The rhythm of the
Polonaise <img src='images/i_121.jpg' alt='♩' id='i_121' class="height3">,
is easily recognized and followed. In the early times, these
polonaises had no composer’s tag, but were often named
for some Polish hero, and thus show the date in which they
were born.</p>

<p class='c008'>One Polish writer dates the “courtly” polonaise from
1573. The year following the election of Henry III of
Anjou, a great reception took place at Cracow, in which all
the ladies of high rank marched in procession past the
throne to the sound of a stately dance. This was the beginning
of the stately polonaise, in which old and young
took part, marching all through the great drawing rooms
and gardens.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Mazurka, another very popular Polish dance, is also
in ¾ time, but faster than the polonaise, and slower than
the waltz. It is performed by a few couples at a time, two
to eight but rarely more. The accent of the measure falls
on the third beat, which distinguishes it from a waltz.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other well known Polish dances are the <cite>Krakowiak</cite> in ²⁄₄
time, the <cite>Kujawiak</cite> in ¾ time, the <cite>Obertass</cite> in ¾ time, the
dance of the mountaineers, called the <cite>Kolomyjka</cite> in ²⁄₄ time,
and the <cite>Kosah</cite> in ²⁄₄ time. All these dances are fast, and all
of them come directly from folk songs.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Spanish Dance-Songs</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It is very hard to tell which of the Spanish folk pieces
are dances and which at first were songs, because the favorite
songs of Spain are nearly all sung as accompaniments
to dancing. Spain had almost as rich troubadour music as
France, because the influence of the troubadours and of the
jongleurs was very strong, Provence being Spain’s neighbor.
In Catalonia the Provençal language has been used since
the 9th century, and the folk music differs from that of
other parts of Spain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The songs of Spain divide themselves into four groups.
The Basque, the music of Biscay and Navarre, unlike any
music of which we have told you, is irregular in rhythm,
melody, and scale, and the <em>jota</em> is one of its characteristic
dances. Galicia and Castile have gay, bright, strong
marked dance rhythms as may be seen from their characteristic
<em>boleros</em> and <i><span lang="es">seguidillas</span></i>. Andalusian music and that
of Southern Spain is perhaps the most beautiful of all, for
here we find the influence of the Oriental music to a marked
degree, in the use of the scale, in florid ornament, and in the
richness of the rhythm; the dances <i><span lang="es">fandangos</span></i>, <em>rondeñas</em> and
<i><span lang="es">malagueñas</span></i> are thought to be finer than the songs. The
guitar is the king of instruments in Andalusia and how
Spanish it is! The fourth group of songs is from Catalonia
of French influence and less Spanish than the others.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Ballad and the Ballet</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the English language we have the word <em>ballad</em>,
which means a long poem in which a story is told. We also
use the French word <em>ballet</em>, for a dance on the stage.
These two words come from the same root, and show that
at one time ballads and dance tunes were practically the
same thing.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>The English dance song, the “round” or the same dance
in France called the <em>ronde</em>, was a popular dance for many
centuries, some of which are most amusing and curious.
One dance tune from the 12th century has Latin words;
there is also a well known tune, Sellenger’s Round, from the
collection called the <cite>Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</cite>. Another
famous ballad (dance) was <cite>Trenchmore</cite>, a good sample
of English folk dance at the end of the 16th century:</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Trenchmore</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>An English writer (how childlike was his fun!) in 1621
says of <cite>Trenchmore</cite>, “Who can withstand it? be we young
or old, though our teeth shake in our heads like virginal
jacks (see page <a href='#Page_310'>310</a>), or stand parallel asunder like the arches
of a bridge, there is no remedy; we must dance Trenchmore
over tables, chairs, and stools!”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Morris Dance</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The English Morris Dance is a sort of pageant accompanied
by dancing. It may have come from the <cite><span lang="es">Morisco</span></cite>, a
Moorish dance popular in Spain and France, or perhaps
from the Matassins, also called Buffoons, who did a
dance in armor, which may have come from the Arabs.
This dance of the Buffoons, popular in France during the
16th and 17th centuries, was performed by four men with
swords, and bells attached to their costumes, used also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>in the Morris Dance. It may have come into England at
the end of the 14th century, but in the 15th it was flourishing.
First it was given as a part of the May festival and
the characters who took part in it were a Lady of the May,
a Fool, a Piper, and two or more dancers. The dance then
became a part of the <cite>Robin Hood</cite> pageant, and the dancers
were called after the characters of the Robin Hood ballad:
Robin Hood, Friar Tuck, Little John, and Maid Marian.
Later, a hobby-horse, a dragon, four marshals, and other
characters were added. The Puritans stopped the Morris
Dance as they thought it too frivolous, and it was never
so popular again.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Cushion Dance</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the <cite>Story of Minstrelsy</cite> is quoted a description of the
Cushion Dance from <cite>The Dancing Master</cite> (1686):</p>

<p class='c008'>“This dance is begun by a single person (either a man or
woman), who, taking a cushion in hand, dances about the
room, and at the end of the tune stops and sings, ‘This
dance it will no further go.’ The musician answers, ‘I
pray you, good sir, why say you so?’ Man: ‘Because
Joan Sanderson will not come too.’ Musician: ‘She must
come too, and she shall come too, and she must come
whether she will or no.’ Then he lays down the cushion
before the woman, on which she kneels, and he kisses her,
singing, ‘Welcome, Joan Sanderson, welcome, welcome.’
Then she rises, takes up the cushion, and both dance, singing,
‘Prinkum-prankum is a fine dance!’” Why not try it?</p>

<p class='c008'>Thomas Morley (1597) wrote of a kind of dance-part-song
called <em>vilanelle</em> or <em>ballete</em>. “These and all other kinds
of light musick, saving the madrigal, are by a general name
called <em>aires</em>. There be also another kind of ballets commonly
called <cite>Fa-la’s</cite>....”</p>

<p class='c008'>When printing was invented these ballads (or ballets)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>appeared in such quantities, that they became a nuisance.
Any subject or event was made into a ballad. They were
usually printed on single sheets so that an instrument like
the viol could play the air, and were carried around in
baskets and sold for a trifle. Ballad-singing in the streets
took the place of the older minstrels, but the newer fashion
never reached the dignity of the bards. These ballads
were used as dances.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both Henry VIII and Queen Mary issued edicts forbidding
the printing of books, ballads, and rhymes, probably
because many were political ballads uncomplimentary
to them. In Elizabeth’s reign the edict was removed, and
many of these dance-songs are found in the plays of Shakespeare
and are sung today in concerts as examples of English
folk music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the better ones have been preserved for us in
the <cite>Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</cite>, which is often wrongly called
<cite>Queen Elizabeth’s Virginal Book</cite>, and in Playford’s <cite>English
Dancing Master</cite> in which there are ninety-five songs used
for dancing; they are also to be heard in the <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite>
which contains sixty-nine airs, among which may be mentioned
<cite>Sally in our Alley</cite>, <cite>Bonny Dundee</cite>, <cite>Green Sleeves</cite>,
<cite>Lilliburlero</cite>, <cite>Over the Hills and Far Away</cite>, etc. John Gay
gathered these folk songs and dances into <cite>The Beggar’s
Opera</cite> in 1727, and it was recently (1920) revived with great
success in London and New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tiersot (an authority on French folk music) has shown
that Adam de la Hale probably wrote the play of <cite>Le Jeu
de Robin et de Marion</cite> and then strung together a number of
popular tunes, many of far older date, to suit his words.
So this pastoral-comedy may be the oldest collection of
French folk tunes in existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>In France, when a dance-air became popular, the rhymers
made up words to fit the music; this was called <em>parodying</em>
it. Our use of the word “parody” means to make fun of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>something, but at that time, the word meant to adapt words
to a melody. One of the early French writers translated the
Psalms for use in the Church, and these very Psalms which
were dedicated to François I, the King, were “parodied,”
so that the people sang them to their favorite dance tunes,—<i><span lang="fr">courantes</span></i>,
<em>sarabandes</em> and <i><span lang="fr">bourrées</span></i>. This happened at a
time when church music was being popularized, and one
hears queer tales of the use of popular songs in the masses
and motets of the 14th and 15th centuries. It sounds
sacrilegious to us, doesn’t it?</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of all the mixing-up of tunes and words, the
French folk dances besides being very charming and winning
were the parents of a most important kind of musical
composition. Just to keep you from being too curious,
the name of this important musical composition is the
Suite—but wait!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(8) <span class='sc'>Funeral Songs and Songs for Mourning</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>All people from the savage state to the most civilized
have had their funeral songs and songs for mourning which
have been characteristic of the day and age to which they
belonged and revealed many tribal and racial beliefs,
superstitions and customs.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>(9) <span class='sc'>Narratives, Ballads and Legends</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We shall not tarry long on this subject for it has been
covered in the chapter on Troubadours and Minnesingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>All primitive races used this means of teaching and preserving
their tribal history, legends, etc., of telling the
news of the day and of praising their over-lords. Many
hundreds of volumes of ballads of all countries are to be
found and are most useful as well as entertaining in the
story of mankind.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Among the most famous narratives known to us are:
the <cite>Sagas</cite> and <cite>Eddas</cite> and <cite>Runes</cite> of the Northlands; the
<cite>Kalevala</cite> of Finland; the <cite><span lang="fr">Percy Reliques</span></cite> of Britain; the
<cite>Odyssey</cite> and <cite>Iliad</cite> of ancient Greece; the <cite>Song of Roland</cite>
of France, <cite>Beowulf</cite> of the Anglo-Saxons, and others, many
of which have been translated and simplified for young
readers.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c016'>National Portraits in Folk Music</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There is one particularly lovely thing about folk songs
and dances and that is the natural labels which they
bear, marking them as belonging to France, Spain, Germany,
Russia and so on. As with people, they all have
similarities and yet no two are the same in looks or in
actions. It would not take you long to know whether you
were hearing a Spanish folk dance, an Irish Jig, a Russian
Hopak, a Norwegian Halling or an American Foxtrot,
because each has its own kind of rhythm and
melody.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some nations have gay, bright folk music, and others
have sad, mournful music. In northern countries where
living is hard on account of the long, dark, cold winters,
and the people are forced to spend much time indoors and
away from neighbors, where money and food are scarce,
they are likely to be sad and lonely. In the centuries gone
by they made up songs that pictured their lives and their
surroundings. On the other hand, in countries where the
sun shines most of the time, where people live out of doors,
are happy, and have many friends and much fun, the music
is gayer and usually lighter. This is why the music of Finland,
Sweden, Norway and northern Russia is so much in
the minor key, and seems grey, and why the music of Italy
Spain, France and other southern countries is in the major
key and seems rosier in color and happier in mood. Other
reasons, too, for sad folk music is oppression, harsh rulers
and harsh laws. So the Finns and Russians, the American
negroes and the Hebrew tribes sang sad songs.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Russian Folk Music</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Again you see history in the songs, particularly in the
Russian folk music, which shows us in musical portraits, the
tragedy of their lives under cruel czars and serfdom. They
sang in ancient scales which make the music all the more
mournful to our ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rhythms in these songs are different from those of
romance languages or those derived from Latin, for the
Russians have a language of Slavic birth. The Russians
have some Oriental blood from the Tartars who invaded
Russia and who were descended from Tartar, a Mogul or
Mongol from Asia. When you hear Russian songs that
sound Oriental, you will agree with Rimsky-Korsakov, the
Russian composer, that the Russian, deep down below the
skin is an Oriental even though he has been living in Europe
for many centuries.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Russia, from the Baltic Sea on the north to the Caucasus
Mountains on the south, from the sunny slopes of the
Ural Mountains on the west, to the bleak desert wastes of
Kirghiz on the east, these mixed races have a common tie in
their love for folk story and folk music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marvelous tales have been handed down by word of
mouth about the river gods and the wood-sprites, about the
animals who talked like men, and the ugly old witch, Baba-Yaga,
whose name alone was enough to quiet the naughtiest
child! Through these folk tales you can follow the Russians
from the time they were primitive men and pagans
through all their battles and the invasions of barbarous
tribes, to the time when they became Christians and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>to struggle against the Tartars, the Turks and the Poles.
All these happenings were put into songs and are the epic,
or tale-telling folk music of the Russians.</p>

<p class='c008'>But one of the most interesting things, we think, in all
the growing of music into maturity, is that Russia never
had anything but folk music until the 19th century!
Music always belonged to the people, and there were no
musical scholars making it the possession of the educated
classes only.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and other Russians took
the folk song from its humble surroundings and used it in
their compositions, for they realized its beauty and its
richness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Russians have instruments brought down from very
early times, which are found today in no other country.
Perhaps you may have heard a Russian <em>balalaika</em> orchestra.
The <em>balalaika</em> is a stringed instrument, with a triangular
body and long neck, having three or sometimes four strings,
which are plucked and sound something like a guitar. It
dates back to the end of the 13th century. They also have
an instrument like a mandolin, with three strings, that
dates from the 13th century also. It came from Asia at
the time of the Mongolian invasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another instrument, a descendant of the Greek <em>psalterion</em>
and known to have been in Russia since the 9th century, is
the <em>gusslee</em>. It is something like a zither, and is composed
of a hollow box, strung with any number from seven to
thirteen up to twenty-four strings. It is held on the lap,
and the strings are plucked with the fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is also a sort of lute or <em>bandoura</em> with many strings,
dating from the 16th century, played principally by the
blind who belong to groups of minstrels. There is also a
wooden clarinet, on which one scale can be played. Its
special purpose was for use at funerals, and its name, which
comes from a word meaning tomb, is <em>jaleika</em>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Finnish Songs</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The Finns, a northern people, although often dominated
either by Sweden or Russia, have their own songs and
peculiar rhythms. The <cite>Kalevala</cite> is their great epic poem,
like the <cite>Iliad</cite> of Greece, <cite>Beowulf</cite> of the Anglo-Saxons, and
the <cite>Eddas</cite> of Iceland. From this narrative poem or epic,
have come many a folk-tune. Besides, they sing of their
beautiful country, often called the country of lakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The typical rhythm of Finland is the ⁵⁄₄ time which sounds
most attractive. They have the <em>kantele</em>, a plucked string
instrument, and they glory in their folk music which they
use as an everyday joy and do not “turn it on” only for
“hey-days and holidays.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Poland’s Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Polish people have loved music as the Russians love
it, and although Poland has been reconquered, divided and
redivided among the surrounding kingdoms of Europe, it
has always kept its own music. So we have another set of
Slav songs but with certain rhythmical differences, not
found in the music of other nations. (Chapter IX.)</p>

<p class='c008'>There is an Oriental strain in this music, too, and it must
be very ancient indeed, for Oriental tribes have not lived
in this country for ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>In addition to an instrument like the Russian <em>gusslee</em>,
and a violin like the Arabian <em>rebab</em>, the Polish have a clarinet
made of wood, called by its old name of <i><span lang="fr">chalumeau</span></i>,
the lute, and an instrument called the <em>kobza</em>, belonging to
the bagpipe family. This is of great age, but is still in use
among the mountaineers of Carpathia, and is made of goat
skin with three pipe attachments. The <em>kobza</em> can replace
an entire orchestra!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Gypsies</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Gypsies! The name fires our imagination and brings up
pictures of dark-skinned, black-eyed people with glossy
black hair, dressed in gay colored shawls, with bright kerchiefs
wound around their heads. We think of them as
being on “one grand picnic,” living out of doors, cooking
their meals over bonfires in the open, sleeping in their covered
wagons or tents, or under the stars, always gay, care-free
and dirty! Then, think of the Gypsy music,—the
dances, the songs, and the wonderful violin playing! So
wild, so weird, so out-of-doors is it, that we are thrilled by
the very thought of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where did these folk come from? Who are they?
What are they? They have spread over most of Europe,
and are found in Hungary, Bohemia, Roumania, Italy,
Spain, Germany, Russia, England, Turkey, and even America.
They are a race and they have a language of their own.
Theirs is a mixture of the ancient <em>Prakrit</em> or Indian, with
the different languages with which they have come in contact
in the course of many centuries. Men who make a
study of the history of languages say, that in their idioms,
they show traces of roving for many centuries in Asiatic
countries, before reaching Europe in or before the 15th century.
They are often called “Bohemians” because Bohemia
(Czecho-Slovakia) seems to have been their main European
camping-ground. It is generally agreed that they came
from India and that they are Asiatic, but they got their
name <em>Gypsy</em>, a contraction of the word Egyptian, because
people at first thought that they came from Egypt.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Gypsies have an extraordinary gift for music. They
do not study it as an art, as we do, and cannot even read
musical notes, but they imitate and memorize, and reach
a high degree of skill in playing, particularly the violin.
They have such great power of imitation, that they rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>learn to play the instruments, and accustom themselves to
the folk music they find wherever they wander. However,
they always keep something of their own sadness and wildness.
In Spain, they accompany themselves on the guitar,
and mark the rhythm with castanets, as do the Spaniards
themselves, borrowing the Spanish folk songs which they
sing in their own way. In Russia, England, Turkey and
everywhere they do the same with the folk music of those
countries.</p>

<p class='c008'>The special traits, then, of the music of the Gypsies, are
found rather in the way they play, interpret and express
the music of others, than as composers of their own music.
Yet they use strongly marked rhythms, florid ornamentation,
and scales that are Oriental, which show us from where
they came. Here is one of their most used scales:</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>[<a href="music/music133.mp3">Listen</a>] [<a href="music/music133.mxl">MusicXML</a>]</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<div id='i_133'  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/music133.png'><img src='images/i_133.jpg' alt='Scales' class='ig001'></a>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There are many kinds of scales among the Gypsies,—a
mixture of the Oriental scale with the pentatonic, and with
the European major and minor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Hungarian Gypsy has made more music than any
other branch of the Gypsy people. In fact, when we hear
music that makes us exclaim, “Oh, that is real Gypsy
music!” it is almost always Hungarian. At least one
quarter of the inhabitants of Hungary, a name which comes
from the barbarian tribe of Huns, are Magyars, descendants
of Tartars and Mongolians of Asia, who settled in the land
of the Huns in the 9th century. In the national music of
Hungary, we find it hard to tell just what is Magyar, and
what is Gypsy, because the two have intermingled for so
long.</p>

<p class='c008'>The important thing is that this Magyar-Gypsy folk
music has been the inspiration of hundreds of trained composers,
like Haydn (see the Gypsy Rondo from his piano
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>trio, also arranged for piano alone), Franz Liszt who wrote
many famous Hungarian Rhapsodies, Hector Berlioz who
made the Hungarian Rakoczy March famous, Johannes
Brahms who used many folk songs in his compositions and
wrote a set of Hungarian Dances. Even Bach, perhaps the
greatest of all composers, seems to have been influenced by
the Gypsy music as played on the Hungarian <em>cembalo</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>No Hungarian Gypsy orchestra is complete without a
cembalo, which looks something like an old-fashioned
square piano with the top off. This is strung with metal
strings covering a range of four octaves, and is played with
two small limber hammers. The cembalo players perform
with great rapidity and agility; they are able to play scales,
arpeggios, trills, and the tricks of Gypsy music with great
skill and ease. It is not known just when this instrument
came into use, but it is a descendant of the <em>dulcimer</em> and
<em>psaltery</em>, instruments we hear of in the Bible, and in Arabia
and Persia, probably brought into Europe during the Crusades.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>czardas</em> (pronounced chardas) is an old Hungarian
dance in which are all the national characteristics of this
folk music, well marked in syncopated rhythms (rhythms
out of focus, page <a href='#Page_144'>144</a>, Chapter X), strong accents, many
ornaments. The Gypsies dance the czardas every time
they get a chance, for they love it. It has two contrasting
parts, one is called <em>lassan</em> which is very slow and sad, and
the other called <em>friska</em> which is very fast and fiery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Panna Czinka, a Gypsy Queen, who lived in the 18th
century was the daughter of the chief of a band of Gypsies
and she inherited his title when she was very young. She
married a ’cellist of her tribe and went all through Hungary,
Poland and Roumania playing on a wonderful Amati
violin, in a very wonderful way. She brought the <cite>Rakoczy
March</cite> to the people, although it is not known whether or
not she composed it. She always wore men’s clothes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>most picturesque type and when she died she requested to
have her beloved violin buried with her! Long after her
death she was still an inspiration to young Gypsy fiddlers,
who all longed to play as beautifully as Panna Czinka.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bohemian Folk Song</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Bohemia is rich in folk dances, most of which are named
for places where they originated or the occasions for which
they were used, or from songs by which they are accompanied.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bohemians have a bagpipe called the <i><span lang="de">Dudelsack</span></i>
and the player is called a <i><span lang="de">Dudelsackpfeiffer</span></i>!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Spanish and Portuguese Folk Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>To the outsider, there is a national color, rhythm, and
charm in Spanish music that is unmistakable. We recognize
it immediately as Spanish, but the Spaniard will be
able to tell you the province from which it came, for there
is as much difference between a Castilian song and a
Basque, as we find between the speech of a Virginian and
a Vermontian! (Chapter IX.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Portugal, although Spain’s next door neighbor, has quite
a different music; it is peaceful, tranquil and thoughtful,
but doesn’t thrill you as does the Spanish music. The
Portuguese are calmer and less excitable than the Spaniards,
so here again you see the character and qualities of people
coming out in the music or what we like to call the musical
portrait of a nation. There are no exaggerated rhythms
but instead a steady melancholy flow of melody.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>French Folk Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The portrait of France that we get from her folk music
is much like the one we find in songs of her troubadours and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>trouvères. In southern France, the folk songs are gay
and filled with poetic sentiment and religious feeling; from
Burgundy come some of her loveliest Noëls (Christmas
songs) and also the drinking songs. From Normandy,
come songs of ordinary everyday doings; their mill songs,
when sung out in the open on a summer night by the peasants
are very beautiful and often show strong religious
feeling. Brittany whose inhabitants were originally Celts
have a music not unlike the Welsh, Scotch and Irish. Long
ago, the famous French writer and musician of the 18th
century, Jean Jacques Rousseau, said of it, “The airs are
not snappy, they have, I know not what of an antique and
sweet mood which touches the heart. They are simple,
naïve and often sad—at any rate they are pleasing.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>German Folk Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The <i><span lang="de">Volkslieder</span></i> or folk songs of the Germans are the
backbone of the great classical and romantic periods of
the 18th and 19th centuries which made Bach, Mozart,
Schubert and Schumann, Wagner and Brahms the music
masters of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>As early as the 14th century collections of these songs
had been made, the subjects of which were mostly historical.
By the 16th century music had grown so much that every
sentiment of the human heart and every occupation of life
had its own song: students, soldiers, pedlars, apprentices
all had their songs. These are folk songs of Class A, because
their composers forgot to leave their names and no
musical archæologist has been able to dig them up. (Page
<a href='#Page_108'>108</a>. Chapter IX.)</p>

<p class='c008'>These songs became melodies independent of the accompaniment.
They also put the major scale on a firm basis
which took the place of the church modes. Their spirit and
power were felt in every branch of music, and they supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>melodies for the chorales or hymns, for the lute players
and organists in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every town had its own band called the <i><span lang="de">Stadt Pfeifferei</span></i>
(town pipers). The peasant boys played the fiddle, and the
shepherds the <em>schalmey</em>, (a kind of oboe). Every festivity
was accompanied by song and dance.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Irish Folk Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>No people in the world have more fancy and imagination,
a keener sense of humor, are more fun-loving and more
superstitious than the Irish. All these qualities come out
in their vast treasure of folk music, which is considered the
most beautiful and the most varied of all the music that
has come from peasant folk. The subjects cover practically
every phase of life from the castle to the cot, and songs of
every heading we have included in the last chapter. There
are reels, jigs, marches, spinning-tunes, nurse-tunes, planxties
(Irish or Welsh melodies for the harp in the nature of a
lament), plough-songs and whistles. The Irish folk songs
are rich historically as well as beautiful musically.</p>

<p class='c008'>The form of the Irish folk music is perfect, and is a model
of what simple song form has been for several centuries.
In fact, all large forms have been built on just such principles
of balance and contrast as are found in an Irish folk
song called <cite>The Flight of the Earls</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Scotch and Welsh Tunes</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Scotch and Welsh also have a very rich store of folk
song and ballads. Along with the Irish they are children
of the early Celts and have brought down to us the music
of early times. In all this music we find the pentatonic
scale, and a rhythm of this character
<img src='images/i_137.jpg' alt='♩' id='i_137' class="height3">
a dotted note
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>followed by a note of shorter value, which gives a real lilt to
Irish, Welsh and Scotch music. We told you about the
Welsh bards and their queer violin without a neck, called a
<i><span lang="cy">crwth</span></i>, and their little harp that was handed around their
banquet tables from guest to guest.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Gaelic music, or that of the Scotch Highlands, dates
back to prehistoric times. You have seen a Scotch Highlander
in his plaid and kilties playing on his bagpipe, and
it has a special kind of scale (two pentatonic scales put together)
like this:</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>G</td>
    <td class='c021'>A</td>
    <td class='c021'>B</td>
    <td class='c021'>&#160;</td>
    <td class='c021'>D</td>
    <td class='c021'>E</td>
    <td class='c021'>&#160;</td>
    <td class='c021'>G</td>
    <td class='c022'>&#160;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>&#160;</td>
    <td class='c021'>A</td>
    <td class='c021'>B</td>
    <td class='c021'>C♯</td>
    <td class='c021'>&#160;</td>
    <td class='c021'>E</td>
    <td class='c021'>F♯</td>
    <td class='c021'>&#160;</td>
    <td class='c022'>A</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c026'>and a drone bass (one tone that does not change and is
played all through the piece) which makes it hard to get the
same effect on the piano. Scotch bagpipes are heard in districts
where the milk-maids and serving folk get together
in the “ingle,” and still “lilt” in the good old-fashioned
way.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thing that makes us know Scotch music from any
other is a queer little trick of the rhythm called the <em>snap</em> in
which a note of short value is followed by a dotted note of
longer value, instead of the other way around which is more
commonly found. Thus: <img src='images/i_138a.jpg' alt='' id='i_138a' class="height3"> but the two ways are
always combined, thus: <img src='images/i_138b.jpg' alt='' id='i_138b' class="height3">
and so on. If you want to make up a real Scotch tune
yourself, just play this rhythm up and down the black keys
of the piano from F# to the next F#!</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the lovely poems of Robert Burns have been
set to old Scotch airs. He saved many of the old songs, for
he gathered the remains of unpublished old ballads and
songs, and snatches of popular melodies, and with genius
gave life to the fragments he found. In his own words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“I have collected, begged, borrowed and stolen all the songs
I could meet with.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Canadian Folk Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Canada has the folk songs of the <i><span lang="fr">habitant</span></i> which are
French in character. They are very beautiful and full of
romance and many of them can be traced back to France.
Many, however, were born in Canada and reveal the hearts
of people who lived in the great lonely spaces of a new
country.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>English Folk Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Most of the English folk songs are very practical accounts
of the doings of the people. The English seemed more interested
in human beings than in Nature, like the Scotch
and Irish, or in romantic love songs like the Latin races in
Spain, France and Italy. The English had to be practical
for they were always leaders and at the head of things, while
the Scots and Irish were further away from the center and
rush of life and so went to Nature for their subjects.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are about five thousand English folk songs which
sing of the English milk-maid and her work, the carpenter,
the hunter and his hounds, and hunting calls. They have
the Morris Dance tunes, the May-day songs, the sailor’s
chanties, they even sing of criminals famous in history and
always very definitely tell the full name and whereabouts of
a character in a song. They also have songs of poachers
(those who hunt on land forbidden them), of murderers and
hangmen as well as shepherds and sailors. But England’s
finest songs are the Christmas carols which sing of the birth
of Jesus. So, if they sang little of Nature they did sing
of man and God and have given us much that is beautiful
and worth while.</p>

<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>American Folk Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We come now to a question that has been the subject of
many arguments and debates. Many claim that we have
no folk music in the United States, and others claim that
we have. It would take a whole volume to present both
sides and we must reduce it to a sugar-coated capsule.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although we know that Stephen Foster wrote <cite>Old Folks
at Home</cite>, <cite>The Old Kentucky Home</cite>, <cite>Uncle Ned</cite>, <cite>Massa’s in
the Cold</cite>, <cite>Cold Ground</cite>, and <cite>Old Black Joe</cite>, they express so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>perfectly the mood and spirit of the people that they are
true folk songs. Harold Vincent Milligan in his book on
Stephen Foster says: “Every folk-song is first born in the
heart and brain of some one person, whose spirit is so finely
attuned to the voice of that inward struggle which is the
history of the soul of man, that when he seeks for his own
self-expression he at the same time gives a voice to that
vast ‘mute multitude who die and give no sign.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>And again speaking of Stephen Foster, Mr. Milligan says:
“Although purists may question their right to the title
‘folk songs’ his melodies are truly the songs of the American
people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The folk music of which we have told you has been the
music portraits of different peoples such as the Russian,
the Polish, the French, the German, the English, the Irish
and so on. If there has been a mixture of peoples or tribes
as in England where there were Britons, Danes, Angles,
Saxons and Normans, it happened so long ago that they
have become molded into one race. We are all Americans
but we are not of one race, and we are still in the process of
being molded into one type.</p>

<p class='c008'>We unite people of all nations under one flag and one
government, but we have been sung to sleep and amused
as children by the folk songs of the European nations to
which our parents and grandparents belonged! And so we
have heard from childhood <cite><span lang="fr">Sur le Pont d’Avignon</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="de">Schlaf
Kindlein Schlaf</span></cite>, <cite>Wurmland</cite>, <cite>The Volga Boat Song</cite>, <cite>Sally in
our Alley</cite>, or <cite>The Wearing of the Green</cite>, none of which is
American.</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of all these obstacles to the growth of a folk
music in America, we have several sources from which they
have come.</p>

<p class='c008'>As our earliest settlers in Virginia and New England were
English, they brought with them many of their folk songs
and some of these have remained unchanged in the districts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>where people of other nations have not penetrated.
<cite>The Lonesome Tunes</cite> of the Kentucky mountains, also
of Tennessee, the Carolinas and Vermont are examples of
this kind of English folk song in America.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Louisiana which was settled by the French, we find
a type of folk song that is very charming. It is a combination
of old French folk song with negro spiritual, and is
brought to us by the Creoles.</p>

<p class='c008'>In California there is a strong Spanish flavor in some of
the old ballads that date from the time of the Spanish
Missions. There are also mining songs of the “days of
’49,” including <cite>Oh Susannah</cite>, by Stephen Foster, and we
defy you to get rid of the tune if once it “gets you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there are cow-boy songs of the Plains, <cite>The Texas
Rangers</cite>, <cite>The Ship that Never Returned</cite>, <cite>The Cow-boy’s
Lament</cite> and <cite>Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie</cite>; the Lumberjack
songs of Maine; the well known air of the <cite>Arkansas
Traveller</cite>, which was a funny little sketch for theatre of a
conversation between the Arkansas traveller and a squatter
which is interrupted by snatches of a tune; and in addition
a whole book full of songs sung in the backwoods
settlements, hunting cabins and lumber camps in northern
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c008'>So if you seek, you can find a large number of folk songs
without going to the Indian or the Negro.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Civil War brought out a number of new national
songs among them <cite>Glory Hallelujah</cite> and <cite>Dixie</cite>. <cite>Dixie</cite> was
written in 1859 as a song and “walk-around” by the famous
minstrel Dan Emmett, and became a war song by accident.
It had dash and a care-free spirit, and the rollicking way it
pictured plantation life attracted the soldiers of the South
when they were in the cold winter camps in the North. Its
rhythm is so irresistible that it makes your hands and feet
go in spite of yourself. Besides these two the soldiers of
the Civil War marched to <cite>Rally Round the Flag, Boys</cite>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span><cite>Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys are Marching</cite>, <cite>Home,
Sweet Home</cite>, <cite>Lily Dale</cite>, <cite>The Girl I Left Behind Me</cite>, <cite>Hail
Columbia</cite> and <cite>The Star Spangled Banner</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have told you so much about the Indian and his
song that it is unnecessary now to dwell at length on his
music. Of course some American composers have used
Indian folk legend and music, but after all it remains the
musical portrait of the Red Man and has not become the
heart language of the white man.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have, however, a real folk-expression that has had a
great deal of influence on our popular music and will
probably help to create a serious music to which we can
attach the label “Made in America,” and that is the music
of the American Negro.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Chapter II we showed you what the Negro had brought
from his native Africa, and also that he had been influenced
by his contact with the white race. His music is not the
result of conscious art and of study but is a natural outburst
in which he expresses his joys and sorrows, his tragedies
and racial oppression. Also we find rhythms, melody
and form that have grown as a wild flower grows, and are
different from any we have met heretofore.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Krehbiel in his book <cite>Afro-American Folksongs</cite> says
of the Negro slave songs: “They contain idioms which were
transplanted hither from Africa, but as song they are the
product of American institutions; of the social, political
and geographical environment within which their creators
were placed in America, of the influences to which they were
subjected in America, of the joys, sorrows and experiences
which fell to their lot in America.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Negro has cultivated, like all races, songs and dances.
As we said of the Russian, his song is sad and full of tragedy,
but the dance is gay, wild and primitive. From the dance
of the Negro we borrowed the rhythm formerly called ragtime,
which is now jazz. The principle of the Negro rhythm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>is syncopation, that is, the accent is shifted to the unaccented
part of a measure or of a beat, like
this,—<img src='images/i_144a.jpg' alt='♩' id='i_144a' class="height3">,
<img src='images/i_144b.jpg' alt='♩' id='i_144b' class="height3">, <img src='images/i_144c.jpg' alt='♩' id='i_144c' class="height3">.
All sorts of combinations are possible in
this rhythm, and it is this variety that is fascinating in a
good jazz tune.</p>

<p class='c008'>The banjo is the instrument of the southern plantation
Negro, and when a crowd gathers for a “sing” or a dance,
the hands and feet take the place of drums and keep
time to the syncopated tune and is called, “patting
Juba.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A curious dance was the “shout” which flourished in
slave days. It took place on Sunday or on prayer meeting
nights and was accompanied by hymn singing and shouting
that sounded from a distance like a melancholy wail.
After the meeting the benches were pushed back, old and
young, men and women, stood in the middle of the floor
and when the “sperichel” (or spiritual) was started they
shuffled around in a ring. Sometimes the dancers sang
the “sperichel” or they sang only the chorus, and for a
distance of half a mile from the praise house the endless
thud, thud of the feet was heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the beautiful Spiritual, the song of the Negro, we see
also the syncopated rhythm. The religious song is practically
the only song he has, and he sings it at work, at
play, at prayer, when he is sick and his friends sing it after
he is dead. To our ears the words are crude and homely,
but always reveal a fervent religious nature as well as a
childlike faith.</p>

<p class='c008'>No doubt you have heard <cite>Nobody Knows the Trouble I
See</cite>, <cite>Deep River</cite>, <cite>Swing Low Sweet Chariot</cite>, <cite>Go Down Moses</cite>,
<cite>Weeping Mary</cite> and many others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a wealth of feeling and beauty could not fail to
leave its mark in the land where it was born.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just how it will bear fruit we cannot say, but it is making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>its appeal more and more, not only to the American, but to
the foreign composers as well, and they believe that this
music,—the syncopated rhythm that the American is at
last developing in his own way—in spite of its humble
origin, is the one new thing that America has given to the
growth of music, and they envy us that wealth of rhythm
that seems to be born in the American.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='c016'>Makers of Motets and Madrigals—Rise of Schools 15th and 16th Centuries</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Don’t you think it strange that we have not told you
of any pieces written for the lute alone, or for the
viol or any other instrument? The reason is that until
1700, there was little music for a solo instrument, but only
for voices alone or for voice and instrument together.</p>

<p class='c008'>The main sport of composers of this time, was to take a
popular tune and write music around it. The popular
tune was called the <i><span lang="la">cantus firmus</span></i> (subject or fixed song)
and the composer who did the fanciest things with the tune
was hailed as great. So instead of wanting to make up
tunes as we do, they were anxious to see what they could
do with old tunes. Times change, don’t they?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Like children who break their toys to see how they work,
they learned to break up the musical phrases into little bits
which they repeated, which they moved from one part to
another; in this way the dividing of themes (tunes) came,
which led them to the use of imitation and of canon; these
early and innocent gardeners finally learned how to make
the trees of the enchanted garden of music bear fruit.
Still timid, they kept the custom for three centuries of
making all their pieces from parts of plain-song or of a
popular song, instead of inventing subjects for themselves;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>thus, what is prized today above every thing else—the
making of original melodies—was secondary in the minds of
the musicians, so busy were they trying to organize their
art, so earnestly were they trying to learn the use of their
tools.” (Translated from the French from <cite><span lang="it">Palestrina</span></cite>, by
Michel Brenet).</p>

<p class='c008'>By spending their time this way, they added much to the
science of music. If it was not pretty, at least it was full of
interesting discoveries which composers used later, as we
shall see, in fugues, canons, suites and many other forms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most popular forms of composition during these two
centuries (the 15th and the 16th) were the motet for Church
and the madrigal for outside the Church.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>What a Motet is</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The <em>motet</em> probably gets its name from a kind of profane
song (not sacred) that was called in Italian <i><span lang="it">mottetto</span></i>, and
translated into French <i><span lang="fr">bon mot</span></i>, means a jest. It dates
back to the 13th century, and was disliked by the Church.
The first motets used in the Church in the early 14th century
are very crude to our ears, but interesting historically.
The composers of the different schools of this period wrote
many of them. Motets were usually those parts of the
church ritual which depended on the day or season. They
were not the regular unaltered parts like the mass itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>This motet, or part-song, used as its central theme a tune
already familiar to its hearers; this tune, the <i><span lang="la">cantus firmus</span></i>
was sometimes a bit from a Gregorian chant or from a mass,
but more often it was a snatch from a dance song or a folk
song with very vulgar words, or it may have been a troubadour
love song with anything but the right kind of words
for the Church. The words for one part were often from
the Bible and for other parts very coarse words from popular
tunes. Imagine singing them at the same time! Still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>funnier, the words of the sacred song were sung in Latin
and the popular song was sung in whatever language it
happened to be written! Can you think of anything more
ridiculous? The masses came to be known by the names
from which the tune was taken and nearly every composer
including the great Palestrina wrote masses on a popular
tune of the day, <cite><span lang="fr">L’homme armé</span></cite> (The Man in Armor). Yet
they were all quite different, so varied had become the science
of writing counterpoint.</p>

<p class='c008'>Josquin des Près (1450–1521) the Flemish composer
wrote a motet, <cite><span lang="la">Victimae Paschali</span></cite>, which is written around
an old Gregorian plainchant, interwoven with two popular
<i><span lang="it">rondelli</span></i> (in French <em>roundel</em> from which comes our terms
<em>roundelay</em> and <i><span lang="it">rondo</span></i>) and a <cite>Stabat Mater</cite> of his. The <i><span lang="la">cantus
firmus</span></i>, or subject of this motet is another secular or popular
air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The popular composers returned the compliment and
took themes or tunes from church music and put secular
words to them. History repeats itself, for we today take
a tune from Handel’s <cite>Messiah</cite> and use it in <cite>Yes, We Have
No Bananas</cite> and we jazz the beautiful and noble music of
Chopin, Beethoven, Schubert and many others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet this music,—the child we are watching grow up—because
of mixing up sacred and profane music soon gets
a big reprimand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The northern part of France seems to have been the
birthplace of the motet; a little later it found its way into
Italy where some of the finest music of the period was
written, and the Italian influence reached into Spain in the
middle of the 15th century; at the end of the century the
Venetian school had spread its work into Germany. In the
17th century the name <em>motet</em> was given to a kind of composition
between a cantata and an oratorio, but it had nothing
to do with the famous motet of the 15th and 16th centuries
which we are discussing.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>To show you how clever the men were in these days, one
composer wrote a motet in thirty-six parts!</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Library of the Sistine Chapel in Rome are volumes
containing the motets of the 14th century, copied, of course,
by hand in notes large enough to be seen and read by the
whole choir! These books are beautifully decorated in
gold and lovely colors, or illuminated, and are of great
value.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Madrigals or Popular Motets</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>All music of this period not composed for the Church
had the general name of Madrigal, but a real madrigal was
a vocal composition for from three to six parts written on a
secular subject, which often gave to the work a grace and
lightness not in the motet. The vocal madrigals were to
the music lovers of that day what chamber music is today,
for instruments were not yet used without singing. Later,
the lute played the chief melody with the voice, and it was
only a step to have other instruments play the other parts of
the madrigal. The instruments played a section of the
composition alone while waiting for a solo singer to appear.
He sang a part of the madrigal that was later called the
air and the instrumental part was called the <i><span lang="fr">ritournelle</span></i>,
which literally meant that in this section of the work, the
singer returned from “off-stage” where he had awaited his
turn. By the end of the 16th century it had become the
custom for motets as well as madrigals to have a solo air
or aria, and an instrumental <i><span lang="fr">ritournelle</span></i>, and this was the
beginning of chamber music,—a very great oak which grew
from a very little acorn.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first printed music books are many of the madrigals
of the early period. We will tell you of the composers of
this period separately, but remember that they all wrote
practically the same kind of music,—masses, motets, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>madrigals, but all with the subject borrowed from something
they knew and with many parts for the voices.
Often, too, the same tunes were used for Church and outside
the Church. For this reason much music was published
without the words, so that the singers could use sacred or
profane words as they wished.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strange as it may seem, it was the folk songs and ballads
and not the <em>learned</em> church music, that had originality and
came freely and sincerely from the hearts of the people.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Songs in Dance Form</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Because these contrapuntal writings were heavy (can you
imagine dancing to a canon?) a new kind influenced by folk
music grew up among these people who were naturally gay
and jolly and wished to be entertained. Songs for three and
four parts appeared, more popular in style and simpler in
form than the church motet and were the descendants of
the music of the troubadours. These were in dance form,
such as the French <em>chanson</em>, the <em>vilanelle</em>, the Italian <em>canzona</em>,
<i><span lang="it">canzonetta</span></i> or little canzona, <i><span lang="it">frottola</span></i>, <em>strambottes</em> and the
German <em>lied</em>. Many of these songs in dance form later
inspired composers to write music for instruments alone,
so that people danced to music without singing. These
dance songs were called <i><span lang="fr">branles</span></i>, <em>pavanes</em>, <em>gaillardes</em>, <i><span lang="fr">courantes</span></i>,
<em>forlanes</em>, <em>rigaudons</em> <em>sarabandes</em>, <em>gigues</em>, <i><span lang="fr">gavottes</span></i> and
many other names.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Lute</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The favorite instrument of the 15th and 16th centuries
was the lute. It fought for first place with the vielle, the
viole, the harp, the psalterion and the portative organ, but
won the fight and took its place beside the most famous
singers of the day, sometimes for accompanying and again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>reaching the dignity of soloist, as we told you above. In
the 15th century it took the form, which we see most often
represented in pictures and in museums, with its six strings,
graceful round body, and long neck bent back as you can
see in plate opposite page <a href='#Page_127'>127</a> already described. As time
went on this lute was made larger and strings were added
until at the beginning of the 17th century, it was replaced
by an instrument called the arch-lute or theorbo, which
had twenty-four strings, a double neck, and two sets of
tuning pins.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spinets or virginals, the great-aunts of our pianofortes
first came into vogue in the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tablature</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>There was a notation called Tablature used in the 16th
and 17th centuries to write down the music for lute and
other stringed instruments such as the viol, cittern, theorbo.
You will find, in pictures of Tablature, lines which look like
our staff, but they do not form a staff, but simply represent
the <em>strings</em> of the instrument. These lines vary according
to the number of strings, from four for the cittern to six
for the lute. The notation showed, not the position and
fingering as we write music, but the position and fingering
of frets and strings. Instead of <em>neumes</em> or notes you will
find the alphabet up to the letter <em>j</em>, figures and queer dots
and lines and slurs, but each sign had its own meaning and
was important to the lutenist.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Rise of Schools</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>As music outgrows childhood, Schools of Music are
started. But these are not like the schools to which we go
every day, but are rather music groups or centers. Suppose
you were a composer and lived in New York and knew a
dozen or so musicians who were writing the same kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>music as you; the music, if good enough to be known and
played, would be called the New York School, or it might
be called the 1925 School! Or, if you were important
enough to be imitated by your followers, it would be called
the Smith School, if that happened to be your name, just as
those who imitate Wagner are said to be the Wagner School,
and so it goes. Not a school to go to, but a school to belong
to!</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes these schools start?” we can hear you ask.
Many things. Sometimes people are oppressed by their
rulers and in trying to forget their troubles, they naturally
want to express themselves in the art they know, and in
this way groups get together and a school grows. Sometimes
the Church is the cause of schools of music, literature,
and art, and we shall see in this chapter how the Church
influenced the schools of music of this time and made it
one of the most important periods in this story. Sometimes,
too, the climate has caused the development of
different styles as we told you in the chapter on folk music.
It often happens too, that a great man or a great school in
one country affects other countries.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Franco-Flemish School</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The first real group of composers to be called a “School”
lived in the part of Europe that today covers the north of
France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The composers
who were born from 1400 to about 1530, in the so-called Low
Countries belonged to this school. Some writers claim
that there were three schools, and that the Franco-Flemish
(Gallo-Belgic) is a bridge between the Paris school of the
14th century and the Netherlands school of the 16th.
But it would be impossible to say when one school began
and another ended, as they all wrote the same kind of music.
As the older composers were the teachers of the younger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the interesting thing to know is that many of these masters
of the north of Europe went to Italy, Spain, France, and to
Germany, and spread the knowledge of the “new art” of
counterpoint and vocal poly-melody (many melodies) and
filled positions of importance in the churches. They were
considered such splendid teachers, that many of the young
students of other nationalities went to Holland and Belgium
to be taught.</p>

<p class='c008'>Zeelandia, a Hollander, an important master in this new
school, tried to get rid of the awkward intervals, fourths
and fifths, which were used in organum (see Chapter VII),
and was the first composer to give the subject or <i><span lang="la">cantus
firmus</span></i> to the soprano voice instead of the tenor. Doesn’t
it seem strange that it took so long to let the soprano have
the main tune?</p>

<p class='c008'>But the most important composer of his period (1400–1474)
was Guillaume Dufay, from Flanders, who was a
chorister in the Papal choir (choir of the Pope) in Rome.
He made the rules and imitation for the canon (a grown up
round) and he was the first composer to use the folk song
<cite><span lang="fr">L’homme armé</span></cite> (The Man in Armor) in a mass.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next important name is Jan Okeghem (1430–1495),
a Hollander, who improved the science of counterpoint and
of fugue writing. We have already mentioned his canon
for thirty-six voices (page <a href='#Page_149'>149</a>), and he wrote some puzzle
canons, for use in secret guilds. No one could solve these
without the key and they were much harder than the world’s
best cross-word puzzles. He tried to make music express
the beauty he felt, and not merely be mathematical problems
in tone, as was much of the music of his day. He was
the teacher of several famous musicians among whom were
Hobrecht (who became the teacher of Erasmus, the learned
Dutch religious reformer), Tinctoris, Josquin des Près,
Loyset Compère, and Agricola who spent most of his life in
Spain and Portugal. In fact, Okeghem taught so many,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>that the art of counterpoint was taken into all countries by
his pupils, so he can be called the founder of all music schools
from his own day to the present. He was chaplain at the
French court and, during forty years there, served three
Kings of France!</p>

<p class='c008'>Tinctoris, a Belgian (1446–1511), founded the first
school of music in Italy at Naples, and wrote a dictionary
of musical terms.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the “Prince” of musicians of the 15th century, was
Josquin des Près, or de Près (1455–1525). He was a pupil
of Okeghem, and although born in Flanders, spent much of
his life away from his home; he was a member of the Papal
choir in Rome and afterwards lived at the court of Louis
XII in France. He also wrote a mass on the theme of
<cite><span lang="fr">L’homme armé</span></cite>, and many other masses, motets, and madrigals.
Luther said of him,—“Josquin des Près is a master of
the notes. They do as he wills. Other composers must do
as the notes will. His compositions are joyous, gentle and
lovely; not forced, not constrained, nor slavishly tied to the
rules, but free as the song of a finch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Josquin des Près had many pupils, and among them were
many who became famous. Clement Janequin, or Jannequin,
is one of the best known from his music, and least
known from the facts of his life. Most of his works are of a
secular nature and are original and amusing, and so perfect
that some people thought him as good as his popular teacher.
He was one of the first serious composers to imitate the
sounds of Nature in music!</p>

<p class='c008'>One of his famous madrigals is the <cite><span lang="fr">Chant des Oiseaux</span></cite>
(Song of the Birds) in which he tries to represent the sounds
of birds of all kinds. In the middle of the piece is heard the
hoot of an owl; the birds get together and chase away the
poor hated owl, calling him a traitor, then all is quiet again.
Another of his pieces is named <cite>The Cackle of Women!</cite> Another
famous one still frequently sung is the <cite>Battle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Marignan</cite> (1515), a lively piece in varied rhythm, which
was one of the most popular army songs of the 16th century.
The words and music imitate, first the tools of war,
then the noise of the cannons and the crackling of the guns,
the joy of victory for the French, and the retreat of the
Swiss.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another eminent pupil of Josquin des Près was Nicolas
Gombert, of Bruges. Like Jannequin, he was a Nature
lover, and many of his madrigals imitate its sounds. Secular
music was now popular, and his works show that a composer
was allowed to give expression to his feelings and
ideas, for the prejudices of the earlier church music had
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Mouton, a native of Metz, was in the chapel of
Louis XII and of François I, King of France. His style
was like his master’s and some of his works were supposed
to have been composed by Josquin.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Willaert Founds the Venetian School</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Willaert was a pupil of both Josquin and Mouton. He
was chapel master at St. Mark’s in Venice, and was so
famous as a teacher that he attracted many good musicians,
and became the founder of the famous Venetian school of
composers. He wrote many madrigals, some of them on
verses of Petrarch, the Italian poet. This work was accomplished
after he was sixty years old!</p>

<p class='c008'>Willaert was the first organist to use two and sometimes
three choirs, each singing in four parts. Sometimes they
sang in combination and sometimes answered each other
antiphonally. According to Clarence G. Hamilton in his
book <cite>Outlines of Music History</cite>, the idea of these choirs was
probably suggested to Willaert because there were in St.
Mark’s two very fine organs. In this you see the influence
instruments have on the growth of musical compositions.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Willaert made use too, of the idea that the different parts
could be sounded together to form chords, instead of individual
melodies as was the case in poly-melody (polyphony
or in the contrapuntal style). This was a new idea, for up
to this time the musicians had been writing horizontal
music, the melodic line looking something like this:</p>

<div id='i_156a'  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i_156a.jpg' alt='S A T B' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Willaert’s idea, which probably came from folk-song and
from some of the hymns that Luther created, was colonnade-like
(see Chapter VII) or perpendicular music, which we
might illustrate like this:</p>

<div id='i_156b'  class='figcenter id002'>

<a href='images/music156.png'><img src='images/i_156c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
</div>

<p class='c026'>in which each line represents a chord, with the melody at
the top. This is how Harmony, or the science of chords,
came into use as we know it now.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among Willaert’s pupils were Cyprian de Rore of Antwerp,
who succeeded his master at St. Mark’s, and most of
his works were madrigals which gained him much fame in
Italy. He was one of the first to use the chromatic scale
(scale in semi-tones like black and white keys on the piano).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>An Italian, Zarlino, pupil of Willaert, must be mentioned
here, not as a writer of music but as the author of three most
important books on harmony and theory. These books
seem to have been very much needed for they were reprinted
many times. Another Italian pupil of Willaert
was Andrea Gabrieli, like his master, also an organist at
St. Mark’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest contribution from this Venetian school was
its important use of instrumental music as an independent
art, thus giving music a great push forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>A composer whose motets and madrigals we still hear
frequently is Jacob Arcadelt, a Netherlander, who spent
most of his life in Italy, and shared with Willaert the glory
of being one of the founders of the Venetian school. He
was a singer at the court of Florence, singing master to the
choir boys at St. Peter’s in Rome, and then he became a
member of the Papal choir.</p>

<p class='c008'>The life of Claude Goudimel seems, from the little we
know, to have been dramatic. He is supposed to have
been in Rome where he taught Palestrina, the greatest composer
of the age. One writer says that he never was in
Rome and was not the teacher of Palestrina! Even his
birthplace is disputed. What is certain, however, is that
he met his death in the massacre of the Huguenots (Protestants)
at Lyons in 1572. He wrote many settings of Calvinist
Psalms by Clement Marot which work led to his
being a victim of the massacre.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sweelinck Founds 17th Century Organ School</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the last of the Netherland school was Jan Sweelinck
(1562–1621), the greatest organist of his time. He
had so many pupils from every country in Europe, that he
became the founder of a very famous school of organists.
Among them were Scheidt, Reinken of whom the story is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>told that Bach as a young boy walked miles to hear him
play, and Buxtehude, a Dane, who was one of the greatest
of the time of Bach. Sweelinck perfected the Organ Fugue
which Bach later made more beautiful than any other composer.
Sweelinck’s talent and work were so deeply appreciated
in his home, Amsterdam, that the merchants of that
city gave him a generous income for his old age. A splendid
thing to have done!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Great Lassus</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The greatest composer of this Netherland school was
Orlandus Lassus, or Orlando di Lasso, or Roland de Lattre,
take your choice! He was born in Mons, Belgium, some
time between 1520 and 1532. When he was a child he had
such a beautiful voice that he was kidnapped three times
from the school where he lived with the other choristers.
The third time he stayed with the Governor of Sicily,
Ferdinand Gonzague, and went from Sicily to Milan, then
to Naples and then to Rome where he became director of
the choir of one of the most celebrated churches. After
this he went to England and to France and finally returned
to Antwerp. In 1557 he was invited to the court of the
Duke of Bavaria in Munich to direct the chamber music.
There he married a lady of the court and had two daughters
and four sons, who were musicians. Later he was made
master of the chapel, and the men who lived at that time
said he was an inspiring choir director, a great composer,
and was deeply reverenced and loved. The Duke was a
splendid helper and patron of music, and encouraged him
to make their choir of ninety men one of the finest in the
world. Their lives were made so pleasant that a book,
published in 1568, says, “had the Heavenly Choir been
suddenly dismissed, it would straightway have made for
the court of Munich, there to find peace and retirement!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Lassus used wind and brass instruments to accompany
the voices which were kept quite separate from the strings.
At a banquet, the wind instruments were heard during the
early courses, then the strings directed by someone else,
then, during the dessert, Lassus would direct the singing
of the choir. So “chamber music” appears at this point in
the growth of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the Duke’s suggestion, Lassus wrote music for seven
<cite>Penitential Psalms</cite> which were sung to the unhappy King,
Charles IX, after the massacre of the Huguenots on St.
Bartholomew’s eve.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote secular music as well as sacred and showed a
keen sense of humor in several of his secular pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after 1574, he wrote a set of twenty-four pieces for
two parts: twelve have words and are vocal duets, and the
other twelve are without words, to be played on instruments.
The two groups are exactly alike in form which shows that
many of the motets and madrigals for voices were often
played on instruments alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Hymn to St. John from which Guido d’Arezzo took
the names of the scale degrees, was made into a beautiful
composition by Lassus; the tenor sings a <i><span lang="la">cantus firmus</span></i> of the
tones of the scales, around which are woven many parts in
counterpoint.</p>

<p class='c008'>One festival day there was a violent storm in Munich,
and orders were given that the usual procession from the
Church through the town should not take place, but should
be held inside the Church. As the head of the procession
reached the porch of the Church, and the choir started a
motet by Lassus, the sun suddenly came out and the procession
went on as usual through the town. This was
looked upon as a miracle, and whenever fine weather was
wanted very much, this motet was chosen! This story does
not tell whether the miracle always worked!</p>

<p class='c008'>In Lassus’ later church music, he simplified the complicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>contrapuntal style, perhaps because he lived in the
country where Luther had introduced the chorale. (Page
<a href='#Page_166'>166</a>.) Even though Lassus wrote masses and motets for
the Catholic Church, he must have heard these new hymns,
and was unknowingly influenced by them.</p>

<p class='c008'>A complete edition of all his works would fill almost sixty
volumes. If you can realize the huge task all this must
have been, you will not be surprised that his over-tired
brain finally gave out and during the last five years of his
life he did no more composing. He died in 1594.</p>

<p class='c008'>Orlandus Lassus was the last and one of the greatest of
this Netherland, or Franco-Flemish school, that for two
hundred years had led the world of music. Music had
changed from a cocoon, gradually developing into a radiant
butterfly, or, in our book, we should say that music had
left childhood and was becoming a stalwart lad.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ronsard—French Poet</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Before leaving the subject of these northern madrigal
writers, we must tell you about the famous French poet,
Pierre de Ronsard, who was born just four hundred years
ago (1525). He supplied more composers with words for
their madrigals than any other poet of his age, and he also
sang some of his poems put to music. He said that without
music poetry was almost without grace, and that music
without the melody of verse was lifeless. Of course, today
the poetry and music have become so independent of each
other, that many poets object to having verse made a servant
of music, and many musicians think that music without
words, that is, instrumental music, is the highest type
of musical art.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1552, Ronsard asked four of the leading composers to
set some of his sonnets to music. Jannequin, Pierre Certon,
Claude Goudimel and Muret accepted, each composing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>music for the same ten sonnets. This experiment was so
successful, that it was the talk of the entire court, and
Ronsard published all the songs in his first volume of poetry.
About the time that Shakespeare was born, in England, but
long before he had said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The man that hath no music in his soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Is fit for treason, stratagem and spoils,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>Ronsard wrote a preface to a collection of songs dedicated
to King Charles IX, in which he says: “How could one get
along with a man who innately hated music? He who does
not honor music, is not worthy to see the soft light of the
sun.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the four musicians who set the sonnets, others
who used Ronsard poems as texts for songs and madrigals
were Philip de Monte (or Mons), G. Costeley, organist to
Charles IX, de la Grotte, organist to Henri III, and Orlandus
Lassus.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c016'>Music Gets a Reprimand—Reformation and Rebirth of Learning—How the Reforms Came to Be</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Here is a little reminder of how music grew:</p>

<p class='c008'>A scale came into use in Greece about 700 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>It was separated into modes by the Greeks about 400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>It was adopted by the Romans and by the early Christians
and was used until the 10th century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> with little
change.</p>

<p class='c008'>450 years before the Christian era was the Golden Age of
Pericles in Greece.</p>

<p class='c008'>450 years after the Christian era was the beginning of the
Dark Ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harmony was first attempted in 900 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>Between 900 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> and 1400, music made little headway.</p>

<p class='c008'>Music has travelled along two roads,—the Church road
and the People’s road; they often crossed each other and became
very much mixed up. You remember how popular
songs had found their way into church music at the time of
St. Gregory, and how the people took melodies from the
masses, put profane words to them, and sang them in the
taverns, at the street corners, in the tournaments and at
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early in the 15th century folk songs had again invaded
the Church to the point that masses were known by the
names of the folk songs from which they were taken. This
led to a very important reform, as a result of which Palestrina,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the greatest composer of the “Golden Age of Catholic
Church Music,” wrote his beautiful masses and motets, and
Luther, the founder of the Protestant faith, made up hymns
that are still sung and loved throughout Christendom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many things happened between 1400 and 1600, the period
called the Renaissance, or rebirth of the ancient Greek and
Roman learning. At this time the people in Italy (later
in Spain, France, England and Germany), awakened to
study after the Dark Ages of war and conquest. Now the
people tried to bring back the literature, drama, music, and
sculpture of the Greeks and Romans. Read this list of
men whose genius developed through the new learning:
Hans Memling, the Flemish painter; Albrecht Dürer, the
German painter and wood and copper engraver; Hans
Holbein, the German painter; Leonardo da Vinci, Italian
artist, engineer and scientist, probably the most gifted man
of all time; Michael Angelo, the Italian sculptor and poet;
Raphael, Correggio and Titian, Italian painters; Cervantes,
the Spanish dramatist, author of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>; Edmund
Spenser of England, who wrote <cite>The Faery Queen</cite>; Copernicus,
the astronomer and Christopher Columbus.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Invention of Printing</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>But the greatest event of this time was Gutenberg’s
invention of printing (1455) which has spread learning over
the face of the earth. Soon people were able to get books
cheaper than the hand written scrolls. Until this great
moment the monks had been writing by hand all books and
music scores. Only the great and wealthy owned them, and
very few could read or write, for what would be the sense
of learning to read if one had nothing to read? So the
invention of printing awakened the desire to know how to
read books and to learn poetry, which sharpened people’s
minds and enlightened them. 12,000 volumes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>printed from 1463 to 1471 where perhaps a hundred had
been written before.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first press (wooden type) was set up by Charles VII
(1459) in the Sorbonne in Paris, one of the greatest institutions
of learning in the world which still attracts students
from all countries. The first music was printed (1501 or
1502) by Ottaviano dei Petrucci in Venice, and were
three or four books of motets by Italian, French, Flemish
and German composers. Music was benefited by being
printed clearly and many changes were made to make it
easier to read. Up to this time it was worse than cross-word
puzzles! It seemed to be the object of the composers before
the Renaissance to make music look just as difficult as it
possibly could, and there are many examples of enigmatical
canons which were used in the spirit of games and could be
solved only by those having the key to the puzzles.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now the printers who were learned men in those days,
simplified the notation, and did away with many useless
signs. People began to read it more easily, and music became
more popular. After Ottaviano died, Antonio Gardane
and his sons founded a publishing house in Venice,
which was most useful to composers. Then Paris and
Antwerp began to have fine printers, and in 1542 Ballard
was made sole printer of music to the King and nearly all
the music through Louis XIV’s time (1638–1715) was
printed by his descendants. Late in the 17th century the
measures were separated by bars as they are today, and
when metal was used for type instead of wood, the old
square note became oval like ours.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the beginning of the Renaissance Church music was
again mixed with the most vulgar words from popular songs.
“The bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes”—as
in <cite>The Hunting of the Snark</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this time the people were beginning to think and read
for themselves, and to question whether the Church had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>the right to dictate to and control them as it had been doing.
They thought, too, that many of the church officers were
not good enough, and by degrees the people protesting,
broke away from the Roman Church and formed others.
Through this protest the Protestant church won its name;
this is known as the Reformation. With the new church
came the need for new services, new music and new ways of
singing.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Martin Luther, the Reformer</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>“Truth to Nature” was the <em>slogan</em> of the Renaissance.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1453, the Mohammedans captured Constantinople,
and the Christian Church which had been there since the end
of the 4th century, was driven out. Many of the learned
Christians fled to Central Europe and brought with them a
knowledge of Greek literature and art which they taught
to the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Christopher Columbus, in his search for a passage to
India, found a new continent, and in the same way these
seekers for “Truth to Nature,” although they may not
have found exactly what they were looking for, certainly
opened gates that swept men and women towards knowledge,
appreciation, refinement and culture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The outstanding person in the Reformation of the Church
was Martin Luther (1483–1546) who interests us specially
for what he did for the growth of music. Luther was a
priest of the Catholic Church, but he was also a German;
he believed in a national life free from Church government,
and in singing hymns in the language of the people instead
of in Latin, in order that the words could be understood.
He spoke and wrote openly against certain actions of the
Church and for this he was put out of the Church of Rome.
But, very soon, he had enough followers to start a church of
his own, and one of the first things he did was to make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>new music for it. Up to this time the only music in Germany
had been some hymns translated from the Latin into
the “vernacular,” the language of the people, the songs of
the Minnesingers and Meistersingers, and a rich crop of
folksongs that had appeared in the 14th century. There
were also a few composers who had learned to write counterpoint
in the Netherlands, Heinrich Isaak, Ludwig Senfl and
Heinrich Fink, and they, too, influenced the music of the
Reformation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Luther, a musician himself, knew the love that his
countrymen had for their hymns translated into German
and for the folksongs, and realized that singing in which
the congregation took part would be a power in the church.
He had to gather material for new hymns simple enough
for the people to sing, and besides he needed new music to
replace the Mass. The result of his work is the <em>chorale</em>,
the foundation of the great German school of music of the
18th and 19th centuries. He was helped in the work of
creating these hymns by Johann Walther and Conrad
Rupf. The first hymnal (1524) was selected from some of
the finest Catholic hymns, Gregorian and Ambrosian melodies,
dignified folk-melodies, and some original chorales by
Luther himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>He played the tunes of his chorales on a flute, and
Walther wrote them down. He wrote to a friend, “I wish
after the example of the Prophets and ancient Fathers of
the Church, to make German Psalms for the people, and
that is to say, sacred hymns, so that the word of God may
dwell among the people by means of song also.” The
strength and beauty of these hymns can be seen in <cite><span lang="de">Ein’
Feste Burg ist unser Gott</span></cite> (A Mighty Fortress is Our God).</p>

<p class='c008'>The hymns were harmonized in four parts. They were
usually sung in unison (all singing the same thing) with the
accompaniment of the organ or a group of instruments.
This great change, or revolt, broke the backbone of polyphonic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>music, freed the spirit of the people, and first brought
into use modern scales (major and minor, as we know them).
Curiously enough, this Reformed Church Music also
brought about the “Golden Age of Catholic Music” with
Palestrina as its leading composer.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="it">Palestrina—Prince of Music</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Martin Luther had hoped to reform the Church but instead
founded a new one (another example of Columbus
seeking a passage to India). But this action of Luther’s
was a challenge to the Mother-Church, and steps were
taken to reform many customs and practices in the Church
itself. As we have pointed out many times, popular tunes
with vulgar words had crept into the Church services.
These works composed for the Church were used to show the
skill of the composer rather than to express the love of God.
Questions dealing with the reforms for purifying the services
of the Church were taken up by the Council of Trent, a
gathering of the learned Church men and the Catholic
kings. The council lasted for twenty years (1542 or 3–1562).
Fancy that for a club meeting! Towards the end of
its long session, the council decided that all music in the
“impure mode” (in popular style), should be banished from
the Church. They decided, and we cannot see why they
waited so long, that the Mass with popular airs and words
not approved by the Church fathers should be prohibited.
Palestrina had both the genius and the understanding to
meet the requirements, and his compositions for the Church
are the highest achievement of the 16th century.</p>

<p class='c008'>You will read in many histories of music that Palestrina
was asked to write three masses to be sung before a group
of Cardinals, in order to find out whether or not any composer
could write music fit for the Church. These three
masses were considered so fine, that he was claimed as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>one who saved Church music. This would have been a
great honor, but it did not happen, and was only a legend to
show Palestrina’s greatness. No doubt Palestrina wrote
more carefully and beautifully on account of the decision
of the Council of Trent, and was so great a composer that
all vocal polyphonic music of the 16th century is said to be
in the “Palestrinian” style.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now this Palestrina was Giovanni Pierluigi, born in a
humble home at Palestrina, a suburb of Rome. In English
his name would be John Pierluigi of Palestrina. The year
of his birth was about 1525 or 1526. He probably was a
choir boy and was trained in music in one of the churches of
Rome. You may hear that the Chapel master of Santa
Marie Maggiore heard him singing on the road and picked
him out for his music school, but this may be only one of
many legends told of him. Even the name of his teacher
is uncertain, some say that it was Goudimel, others that it
was Gaudio or Claudio Mell, and still others that it was
Cimello. However, his teacher’s name seems to have had
the letters “mel” in it, and all the rest is guess work. Before
he was twenty, he played the organ in a church at
Palestrina, sang in the daily service, taught singing and
music, and shortly after was married.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1551 he became chapel master in the Capella Giulia
(Julia Chapel) in the Vatican. His first published volume
of five masses (1554) he dedicated to the Pope, Julius III.
There had been many volumes of sacred music dedicated
to the popes, but they had always been the work of musicians
of the northern school, Hollanders or Belgians. This
volume of Palestrina’s was the first by an Italian composer
to be written for a pope. As a reward, the Pope made him
one of the twenty-four singers of his private chapel, but
not having a good voice, and not being a priest, the next
Pope dismissed him. But in 1571 he was again made chapel
master in the Vatican.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>It was the custom in those days for musicians to dedicate
works not only to popes, but to rich and powerful nobles,
monarchs, or other church officials. These attentions were
often rewarded with gifts of money, positions at court or in
the chapels. This “patronage,” as it was called, made it
possible for composers to do their best work. This was not
only the case in music, but in poetry, painting and sculpture.
Palestrina was kept busy dedicating his music to
popes, for he lived during the reigns of at least twelve.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the Council of Trent, one of his masses was recommended
as a model, so it is said, of what church music
should be. He was again granted the pay of singer in the
Pontifical Choir, as he had been years before, but this time,
due to his well-known skill, he did not lose his post when
other popes succeeded in office. Many of his masses in
manuscript are now in the Vatican library.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1575, fifteen hundred singers from Palestrina,—priests,
laymen, boys and women, marched into Rome singing
Giovanni Pierluigi’s music, with the great composer leading
them. This shows, that he was appreciated.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was asked to revise some of the old church music and
while he tried, he so hated to change the work of other composers
whom he respected, that he never finished the task.
It was like asking Stravinsky to put up-to-date harmonies
into Beethoven.</p>

<p class='c008'>A list of his compositions published by Breitkopf and
Haertel include 93 Masses, 179 Motets, and 45 Hymns for
the year, 68 Offertories, 3 books of Lamentations, 3 books of
Litanies, 2 books of Magnificats, 4 books of Madrigals. A
big list, isn’t it? But his activities covered a long period,
and he composed to the time of his death (1594).</p>

<p class='c008'>He had very few pupils whose names have come down to
us.</p>

<p class='c008'>Palestrina never had great wealth, and some biographers
make him seem poverty-stricken and suffering. At any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>rate, he was granted his heart’s desire, to compose as much
as he wanted to, and even if he was poor, he had the joy of
success and the glory of being recognized as the greatest
composer of his time in Italy. His works have outlived
many other schools of composition, and today are looked
upon as models of beauty and of masterly workmanship.</p>

<p class='c008'>Palestrina was honored by burial in St. Peter’s, and on
his tombstone are the words “Princeps Musicæ” (Prince
of Music).</p>

<p class='c008'>You must not think that Palestrina was the only famous
Italian composer of the 16th century, for Constanza Festa
who died before Palestrina did his important work is called
the first Italian master of the polyphonic school. There
were also Animuccia, Andrea Gabrieli, and Andrea’s
nephew Giovanni Gabrieli. Giovanni was a Venetian,
and the Venetians loved rich coloring in everything, even
in their music. Gabrieli tried to get it by using cornets,
trombones and violins with the organ, which at that time
could not make a <em>crescendo</em>, that is, its volume could not be
increased, but as these instruments could all be played soft
or loud with <em>crescendo</em> effects, he created a color or quality
that never had been before.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='c016'>Birth of Oratorio and Opera—Monteverde and Heart Music</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>Birth of Oratorio and Opera</span></h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c029'>A friend of Palestrina, Saint Filippo Neri, was the
founder of Oratorio. In 1558, Father Neri started
daily religious meetings to which all sorts of people came.
These were held in a side room of the Church called the
Oratory (chapel for private prayer), and in addition to his
talks,—hymns, litanies and motets were sung, and scenes
from the Bible were performed somewhat like opera. The
name “Oratorio” was soon used, not only in Rome, but
throughout all of Europe, wherever there were sacred
dramas with music. Palestrina arranged and wrote some
of the music for Father Neri.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bible Stories Acted</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The acted stories of the Bible can be traced back into the
Middle Ages, and probably descended from the Greek and
Roman theatre, for many early Christians were Greeks and
Romans and had a natural love for drama. The Church
understood this and saw in it a way to teach the history of
the Scriptures. You know yourselves how much better
you remember historical events when you have seen them
in moving pictures! This natural love of play-acting in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>mankind goes back to primitive man who acted out his
prayers in his religious rites. These theatrical performances
were called “moralities,” “mysteries,” or “miracle-plays,”
and a very beautiful example is <cite>Everyman</cite>, which was revived
in England and America a few years ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the 8th century, Charlemagne’s time, people gathered
in the public markets, and the merchants entertained them
by shows in which were singing and dancing. The priests
forbade these performances because they were coarse and
vulgar, but realizing how successful and how much loved
they were, they themselves turned actors, built stages in
many of the churches, turned the Bible stories into little
plays, and added music. Sometimes when there were not
enough priests to take part, dolls or puppets were used as
in <cite>Punch and Judy</cite> shows. Isn’t it interesting to think that
operas and plays began in the Church?</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most famous of the church plays was the
<cite>Feast of Asses</cite> in the 11th century.</p>

<p class='c008'>The people did not have means of entertaining themselves
as we have, and the Church was the place to which every
one went for amusement as well as religion. In the 14th
century some plays given in England were: <cite>Fall of Lucifer</cite>,
<cite>Creation</cite>, <cite>Deluge</cite>, <cite>Abraham</cite>, <cite>Salutation and Nativity</cite>, <cite>Three
Kings</cite>, <cite>Last Supper</cite>, <cite>Resurrection</cite>. The clergy hired minstrels
during this period to supply the music.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the 15th century there were also elaborate pageants.</p>

<p class='c008'>The clergy soon saw that the people wanted to take part
in the plays, so societies were formed in Paris, Rome, and in
England for the people. In England, like in Germany in
the 16th century, the guilds (trade-unions) performed plays
that were based on religious subjects, although more or less
comic. The trade-guild of water-drawers, who delivered
water from door to door, liked to give the <cite>Deluge</cite>! The
story goes: Mrs. Noah objected to going aboard the ark
with her husband and children, because she did not want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>to leave her friends, “the gossips”; she even tells Noah to
get himself another wife, but her son, Shem, forces her into
the ark, and when she finally enters, she slaps Noah’s face!</p>

<p class='c008'>The subjects were not always comical, some were beautiful
and inspiring, like the <cite>Passion Play</cite> still given in
Oberammergau, Germany, every ten years.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Masques</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>During Henry VII’s reign (1485–1509), which began the
Tudor period, the moralities and religious pageantry were
at their best, and the Masques began. Nobles, who appeared
at balls in gorgeous costumes with masked faces,
danced, had a jolly time, and usually surprised the guests
with an elaborate entertainment in pantomime with much
music and dancing. This became more and more important
until it combined poetry, instrumental and vocal music,
scenery, dancing, machinery, splendid costumes, and
decorations in the Masque.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest masques were written in the reigns of the
Stuarts (17th century), by Ben Jonson, Beaumont and
Fletcher, and John Milton. <cite>Comus</cite> and Shakespeare’s
<cite>Tempest</cite> were set to music in this form. While the Italians
were experimenting with <cite><span lang="it">Dramma per Musica</span></cite> (drama with
music), England was finding a new musical entertainment
in the masque, and opera was its direct descendant.</p>

<p class='c008'>The custom of masking for the ball came from Italy, and
before that, the actors in the Greek drama (400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) wore
masks, and that is why the mask is used in art to represent
the theatre.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Italian Opera’s Beginnings</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In Italy during the second half of the 16th century, a
group of people tried to combine music and drama to fit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the new ideas of art. The Renaissance had influenced
poetry, sculpture, painting, architecture, and now it was
music’s turn to profit by the return to Greek ideals. The
Florentines and the Venetians felt that the madrigal was
not the best form to express the feelings and emotions of
the subjects of their plays. In the Middle Ages, the subjects
were always Biblical, but now, as a result of the new
learning they were chosen from Greek mythology and
history. From the first operas at the close of the 16th
century, to those of Gluck in the 18th, the names of Greek
gods and heroes are used as the titles of operas: <cite>Orpheus</cite>,
<cite>Euridice</cite>, <cite>Daphne</cite>, <cite>Apollo</cite> and <cite>Bacchus</cite>. These first operas
were a combination of early <em>ballets</em>, and a sort of play called
a <i><span lang="it">pastorale</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Torquato Tasso, the Italian poet of the 16th century,
wrote several <i><span lang="it">pastorales</span></i>, and was interested in music with
drama. Like Ronsard in France, Tasso wrote beautiful
poems for madrigals, which were set to music by the composers.
He was a friend of Palestrina and of Don Gesualdo,
Prince of Venosa, a famous patron of art, particularly
of music. In the Prince’s palace at Naples, a group of men
met to spread and improve the taste for music. They also
wished to create music that would fit the stage-plays better
than the polyphonic or poly-melodic style imported from
the Northern countries. They wanted melody and they
wanted it sung by one voice alone, as were their popular
songs, accompanied by the lute, called <i><span lang="it">frottoli</span></i>, <em>vilanelles</em>, etc.
Tasso, no doubt, talked over his ideas with composers from
Florence who had formed a club, and who were directly
responsible for the first opera in Italy, <cite>Daphne</cite> by Jacobo
Perti.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Camerata</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>This Florentine club was called the “Camerata”; it met
at the home of Count Bardi, himself a poet, and among its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>members were Vincenzo Galilei, an amateur musician and
father of the famous astronomer; Emilio del Cavalieri, a
composer and inventor of <em>ballets</em>; Laura Guidiccioni, a
woman poet; Giulio Caccini, a singer and composer;
Ottavio Rinuccini and Strozzi, poets; and Peri, a composer
and singer. They must have had wild times at their club
meetings, for the musicians who were not amateurs did not
want the popular song with lute accompaniment to replace
polyphonic music, which was the “high-brow” art of that
time. But the poets and singers and less cultured musicians
won the day. Pretending to return to Greek music
drama of which they knew less than nothing, they made a
series of experiments which led to the invention of the artsong,
or homophonic style (one voice, or melody, instead of
polyphonic—many voices), which seemed to satisfy the
Italian’s natural love for melody.</p>

<p class='c008'>Galilei set a scene from Dante’s <cite>Inferno</cite>, for solo and
<i><span lang="it">viola da gamba</span></i>, an instrument of the violoncello type.
Following this, Peri invented the “speaking style” of
singing now called <em>recitative</em>. This was a very important
step in the making of opera and oratorio, for it did away
with spoken words, and instead, the conversation was sung,
or intoned, to satisfy the poets who wanted the meaning of
their words made very clear. It was accompanied by
simple chords on the lute, and later, the harpsichord.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here were all the parts needed for a real opera,—the solo
song, or aria; the recitative, or story telling part; the
chorus or ensemble, which was the old madrigal used in a
new way; and the accompanying instruments which grew
into the orchestra. Peri was the first to put all these parts
together in an opera for which Rinuccini wrote a real play
based on the Greek story of Daphne. Caccini and his
daughter Francesca sang it, and no doubt made many suggestions
as to how it should be done. Its first private
performance (1597) was an important event for the closing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>of an important century. The audience thought that it
was listening to a revival of Greek music drama, but we
know that it was another case of Columbus’s passage to
India! Although the Greek drama was not like this, after
2000 years it helped to create modern music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its success led to an invitation in 1600 for Peri and Rinuccini
to write an opera, <cite>Euridice</cite>, for the marriage festivities
of Henry IV of France and Marie de’ Medici. Several
noblemen, probably members of the “Camerata,” took
part in the first performance; one played the harpsichord,
and three others played on the chitarrone (a large guitar), a
viol da gamba, and a theorbo (double lute). The orchestra
was completed by three flutes. This orchestral score was
notated in a sort of musical shorthand called figured bass
which shows the chords to be used as accompaniment to a
melody by means of a bass note with a figure above it.
Peri and his colleagues seem to have been the first to use
this, but it was adopted by all composers into the 18th century,
including Bach and Handel. It was called <i><span lang="it">basso continuo</span></i>
or figured bass or thorough-bass.</p>

<p class='c008'>Caccini also wrote an opera which he called <cite>Euridice</cite>,
but it was in the style of a pastoral ballet with songs,
dances, and recitatives. This work was probably the result
of his having helped Peri in working out his ideas at
the meetings of the “Camerata.” This same year, 1600,
which finished the 16th century, saw the presentation of
Emilio del Cavalieri’s mystery play, or oratorio, <cite><span lang="it">La Rappresentazióne
di ‘Anima e di Córpo</span></cite> (Representation of the
spirit and body), for which Laura Giudiccioni wrote the
text. This oratorio, with very elaborate decorations, was
sung and danced in the oratory of a church. It must have
been very like the operas except that it was based on a religious
idea, and was performed in a church, while the opera
by Peri was performed at the Pitti Palace and was from
Greek mythology. The orchestra was composed of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>double lyre, a harpsichord, a double guitar, and a theorbo
or double lute.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Baif’s Club in France</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>While the Italians were trying to find the old Greek and
Latin methods of combining drama and music, there was a
movement in France to write poetry in classical verse.
Following Ronsard’s example, Baif influenced the composers
to write music that should express the feeling of
poetry, and also imitate its rhythm. They also tried writing
madrigals arranged for a single voice with accompanying
instrument, or group of instruments. While the Italians
invented the recitative, the French developed a rich
fluent rhythmic song form, <i><span lang="fr">musique mesurée à l’antique</span></i>, or,
music in the ancient metre.</p>

<p class='c008'>Baif formed a club or an Academy of poets and musicians
much like Bardi’s “Camerata” in Florence. They worked
hard to perfect mensural or measured music, and opened
the way for the use of measures and bars, which in the 16th
century were unknown. We are so accustomed to music
divided into measures by means of bars, that it is hard to
realize what a great step forward was made by Baif’s
Academy. They were struggling to get rid of the plainchant
which lacked rhythm as we know it, and which for
centuries had used “perfect” or “imperfect” time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two prominent composers of this group were Jacques
Mauduit (1557–1627), also a famous lute player, and Claude
Le Jeune (1530–1600), who worked with Baif to bring
“measured” music into favor, composer of many <i><span lang="fr">chansons</span></i>
and of a Psalm-book used by all the Calvinist churches
(Calvin was a church reformer in Switzerland) in Europe
except in Switzerland! It went through more editions than
any other musical work since the invention of printing.
Le Jeune was a Huguenot, and on St. Bartholomew’s eve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>(1588), he tried to escape from the Catholic soldiers carrying
with him many unpublished manuscripts. They would
have been burned, had it not been for his Catholic friend
and fellow-composer, Mauduit, who rescued the books, and
saved his life. The title appears for the first time in history
on one of his pieces, “Composer of Music for the King.”
(<cite><span lang="fr">Compositeur de la musique de la chambre du roy.</span></cite>)</p>

<p class='c008'>During the second half of the 16th century, in spite of
serious political and religious troubles, the most popular
form of entertainment at the French court was the very
gorgeous ballet. No expense was considered too great, and
no decoration too splendid for these ballets in which nobles
and even the kings and their families appeared “in person.”
They were like the English Masques, and were the parents
of the <cite>French opera</cite>. Baif, Mauduit and Le Jeune, together
composed (1581) <cite><span lang="fr">Le Ballet comique de la Reine</span></cite> (Queen’s
Comedy-Ballet) which was produced at the Palace of the
Louvre in Paris.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beaulieu and Salmon are often named as the composers
of this ballet because in those days, one composer wrote the
parts for voices, and another for instruments, so probably
the musicians worked with the poets and dramatists to
produce it. The characters in this musical drama were
Circe and other Greek gods and demi-gods.</p>

<p class='c008'>With Marie de Medici and Cardinal Mazarin from
Italy, Italian opera came into France. But this did not
happen until the 17th century.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Monteverde and Heart Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Wouldn’t you be proud if you could compose a whole
book of music at the age of sixteen? Monteverde did and
besides he made music grow by composing things that had
never been done before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claudio Monteverde (1567–1643) was born in Cremona,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>a town made famous by the great makers of violins. Monteverde
was one of the first great innovators in music, and
he brought new ideas and vast changes into music as an
art. His teacher, Marc Antonio Ingegneri, Chapel Master
at the Cathedral, taught young Monteverde all the tricks of
counterpoint and of the great polyphonic masters, and also
gave him lessons on the organ and the viol. He must have
been a very talented pupil, for he could play any instrument,
and at the age of sixteen, published his first book of
madrigals,—<cite><span lang="it">Canzonette a tre voci</span></cite> (Little Songs in Three
Voices). The last song in this book has these charming
words: “Now, dear Songs, go in peace singing joyously,
always thanking those who listen to you and kissing their
hands, without speaking.” Evidently, little Italian boys
were brought up to say nice things!</p>

<p class='c008'>Even in this first book of madrigals and the four books
that followed, Monteverde tried experiments in harmony
and wrote music that sounded harsh to 16th century ears.
He was trying to create a style that would combine the
best points of the old school of polyphony (many voices)
with the new school of monody (one melody), and this is why
he is called the originator of the modern style of composition,
which is, melody and accompaniment. Since his time
there have been many originators of new styles in music,
and when first heard they have usually been received with
harsh words by the many and liked by the few. Monteverde
was severely criticized in a book that appeared in
Venice, in 1600, on the short-comings of modern music,
(and they are still writing “on the short-comings of modern
music” today!). The book was written by the monk,
Artusi, who liked the old-fashioned music and believed
that Monteverde’s work was against all natural musical
laws. But if we search we will find that music grows
through experiments that are made by the composers,
who “go against natural laws,” then after the natural laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>are broken, comes a learned theorist who shows that no
law was broken at all, and so we go on stretching the
boundaries of “natural law,” and music goes on changing
all the time. This is what we mean by the growth of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1590, Monteverde became viol player and singer to
Vincenzo di Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, a patron of arts
and letters. At one time he took the poet Tasso from an
insane asylum; he was patron of Galileo, the astronomer,
who was considered to be a heretic because he said that
the earth revolved around the sun, contrary to the teachings
of the Bible; he also invited the great Flemish painter
Rubens, to visit his court; and probably influenced Monteverde
to write operas. The Duke engaged many musicians
at his court, who formed a little orchestra to play
dance music, solos, or parts in the madrigals. These were
no longer sung alone, but were accompanied by instruments,
or sometimes played by the instruments without voices,
(see how music grows up!) because in Italy, the composers
had not yet begun to write special music for instruments as
they had in France.</p>

<p class='c008'>The composer went with the Duke on many travels,
even into battle, and in the evenings between military encounters,
they sang madrigals and played on instruments!</p>

<p class='c008'>The next trip with the Duke was pleasanter, for it gave
Monteverde the chance to visit Flanders, where he heard
the beautiful “new music” of Claude Le Jeune, Mauduit,
and others. It impressed him so deeply that he began to
write heart-music instead of head-music. He was one of
the most successful in breaking down old rules and traditions
and was enough of a genius to replace them with new
things that were to point the way for all the opera writers
and most of the composers that came after him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Monteverde must have heard the music composed by the
members of the “Camerata,” but he was too much of a
musician to brush aside all polyphonic writing and to value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>words above music. However, their work opened the way
for his. Up to 1607, he had written everything in the form
of vocal madrigals, but his last book seems to have been
composed for string instruments instead of being madrigals
for voices. These sounded as though composed for viols
and lutes and not for voices, and were dramatic and full of
deep feeling as if written for an opera! No wonder they
sounded strange to the audience—even as Stravinsky,
Schoenberg and Milhaud do to most people today.</p>

<p class='c008'>Until Monteverde was forty years old he had never written
an opera, the greatest work of his life! He probably
would not have done so then had it not been at the command
of his patron, Vincenzo di Gonzaga. His first and
second operas, <cite><span lang="it">Orfeo</span></cite> and <cite>Arianna</cite>, followed each other
quickly and were epoch making. Without the work of the
“Camerata,” they might never have been written, but they
were much better than the best work of the “Camerata”
(Peri, Caccini, and Cavalieri). Monteverde was wise
enough to adopt their melodramatic form which he improved
by his use of the devices of the Italian madrigalists
and organ composers, and the <i><span lang="fr">airs de cour</span></i> (songs of the
court) and the ballets of the French composers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Also, following the French ideas, Monteverde used a
large orchestra of forty pieces, including two clavichords;
two little organs called <i><span lang="it">organi di legno</span></i>, which sounded like
flutes; a regal, also a kind of small organ; a bass viol; a <i><span lang="it">viol
da gamba</span></i>; two very tiny violins called <i><span lang="fr">pochettes</span></i>, because
they could be carried in the pockets of the French dancing-masters;
ten <i><span lang="la">violes da bracchia</span></i> or tenor viols; ordinary violins,
two <em>chitarroni</em> or large lutes, and the usual trumpets,
cornets, flutes and oboes. In this Monteverde was a
pioneer for he had no other works to guide him, and had to
find out for himself the effects of combining different instruments.
Today many of his musical effects sound crude
to us, but he had no symphony concerts, at which to hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>an orchestra, for such a thing did not exist. Neither were
orchestral scores written out, but only indicated, and when
instruments were used, their parts were made up at the
moment and played, according to the “figured bass.”</p>

<p class='c008'>During the 16th century, the musicians had learned that
trombones and cornets made a wonderful effect in scenes of
the underworld (Hades, Inferno, Hell), of which there were
many. They discovered, too, that trumpets and drums
made battle scenes and war songs real; that flutes, oboes and
bassoons gave a pastoral, or shepherd-like effect; that viols
were for scenes of love and of sadness; and that to represent
Heaven, they needed harps, lutes and regals. Monteverde
brought them all together, and studied how to simplify
the orchestra to give it a better balance in tone and
variety. It must have been a wonderful time to live in
this “young manhood” day of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>The opera <cite>Arianna</cite> was written a year after <cite><span lang="it">Orfeo</span></cite>, to
celebrate the wedding of the Duke’s son. It must have
been a sad task for Monteverde, as he had just lost his
wife to whom he was very devoted. Ottavio Rinuccini,
poet of the “Camerata”, was his librettist (the writer of the
words), and a famous Italian architect, Vianini, built an
immense theatre in the castle for the first performance in
1608. Six thousand people assembled, the largest audience
that had ever heard an opera! Nothing remains of the
opera today, but the text, or words, some published accounts
of the performances, and a very touching and
beautiful <cite>Lamentation</cite> in which Arianna expresses her grief
at being left by Theseus. This one piece is enough to
show Monteverde’s genius, also how freely he expressed
human feelings in music. Not a house in Italy with either
a clavichord or a theorbo was without a copy of the <cite>Lamentation</cite>!</p>

<p class='c008'>About this time, Monteverde wrote a prologue for a
comedy composed by five other musicians of the court, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>well-known composers of their day, Rossi, Gastoldi, Gagliano,
Giulio Monteverde, and Birt.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1613, a year after the death of the Duke, Vincenzo di
Gonzaga, Monteverde was made Chapel master of St.
Mark’s in Venice, which had long been famous for its fine
music, where Adrian Willaert, Cyprian de Rore and Zarlino
had been Chapel masters in the time of the “Golden Age of
Polyphony.” Monteverde had much to live up to! But,
after his hard work at the court of Mantua, he found his position
very agreeable, and he gave his time now to composing
music for the Church, madrigals, intermezzos, and a new
form of music called “cantata.” His church music can be
divided into works written in the old polyphonic style of
Palestrina, and those written in the modern style of his
day. So, when he did not write in the older church style, it
was not because he did not know counterpoint, but because
he wanted to make music express feelings through harmony
and not through polyphony. He was able to do this as no
one else had! His church music is not published for the
parts have been so scattered, that a bass will be found in
one collection and an instrumental part in another, and
perhaps a soprano in still a third. So it would be very
much like a jig-saw puzzle to find them all and put them together.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Gonzaga family tried to persuade him to return to
their court, but he refused, although he often wrote special
operas for them or short dramatic spectacles which were
called intermezzos. Of these, sad to say, almost nothing
remains.</p>

<p class='c008'>The recitative style invented by the “Camerata” had by
this time taken such a firm hold upon the people, that it
spread even to the music of the Church and to the madrigals.
All the Italian composers began to write <em>recitative</em>
for solo voices and accompaniment which they called <i><span lang="it">canzoni</span></i>
(songs), <em>canzonetti</em> (little songs), and <em>arie</em> (melodies).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Monteverde was one of the first to turn the madrigal into
a <i><span lang="it">cantata da camera</span></i> which means the recitation to music of
a short drama or story in verse, by one person, accompanied
by one instrument. But, as things improve or die out,
very soon another voice and several instruments were
added. This composition is a musical milestone of the 17th
century as the madrigal had been of the 15th and 16th.
The cantata for more than one voice forms a little chamber
music opera without any acting. Some of the best known
cantata writers were Ferrari, Carissimi, Rossi, Gasparini,
Marcello, and Alessandro Scarlatti. At the age of seventy,
Monteverde took up this new style of composition with all
the enthusiasm and freshness of a young composer! He
was not the inventor of the <i><span lang="it">cantata da camera</span></i>, as is so often
claimed for him, as no one man was its inventor. It was
the result of the constant search of the composers of that
day, who followed along the same path, and worked together
to perfect a new form.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>New Feelings Expressed</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of Monteverde’s most important works in this style
is the <cite>Combat of Tancredi and Clorinda (<span lang="fr">Combattimento di
Tancredi e di Clorinda</span>)</cite> a poem by Tasso, which is noteworthy
for several new things. In the preface of the published
edition, Monteverde says that he had long tried to
invent a style <i><span lang="it">concitato</span></i>, or agitated, that he had been struck
by the fact that musicians had never tried to express anger
or the fury of battle, but had expressed only tenderness and
sweetness, sadness or gayety. (Perhaps he did not know
Jannequin’s <cite>Battle of Marignan</cite>.) So he wrote battle music.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second innovation was the tremolo, which, however
familiar to us today, he used for the first time to express
agitation, anger and fear, and the musicians were so surprised
to see something that they had never seen before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>that they refused to play it! This was neither the first nor
the last time that musicians balked at something new.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third innovation was that he wrote independent
parts for the orchestra, and for the first time the instruments
did not “copy” the voice, but had notes all to themselves
to play.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1630 there was a terrible epidemic in Venice, the
“Black Plague” which lasted a year and took off one-third
of her population! In gratitude for having been spared,
Monteverde became a priest in the Church. This did not
seem to interfere with his composing secular works, for after
this, he wrote several operas.</p>

<p class='c008'>Venice was the home of the first public opera house in the
world! It was opened (1637) in the San Cassiano theatre
by Benedetto Ferrari and Francesco Manelli, and for this
in these last years of his life, Monteverde wrote some of his
most important operas. Monteverde’s operas of this time
were a combination of the Roman <i><span lang="it">opera-cantate</span></i>, then in
style, and his first operas, <cite><span lang="it">Orfeo</span></cite> and <cite>Arianna</cite>, written
thirty-five years before. He had great enough genius to
fit his work to the conditions that he found in the opera
house, so that when they had to reduce expenses, Monteverde
cut down the size of his orchestra to just a clavichord,
a few theorbos, a bass viol and a few violins and
viols, and wrote works without choruses! He was agreeable,
wasn’t he? A thing which people of “near” greatness
rarely are!</p>

<p class='c008'>The last work he composed at the age of 74 is one of his
best! Is it not wonderful to think that he had not lost inspiration
and enthusiasm after a long life of hard work?
The Italian name for his last opera is <cite><span lang="it">Incoronazione di
Poppea</span></cite>, or the “Coronation of Poppea.” It is a story of
the court of Nero, and Monteverde has sketched his characters
in vivid music, and has made them seem true to
life. Henry Prunières, who has made an earnest study of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Monteverde says in his book, <cite>Monteverde</cite>, “Monteverde saw
Imperial Rome with eyes of genius and knew how to make
it live again for us. No book, no historical account could
picture Nero and Poppea as vigorously as this opera.”
It is the greatest opera of the 17th century, and actually
created the school of Italian grand opera. With it,
mythological characters gave way to the historical in opera,
which enlarged the field of drama with music.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Monteverde, the great innovator, died in Venice in
1643 and was given by the citizens of Venice a funeral
worthy of his greatness.</p>

<p class='c008'>He dug new paths on which all modern composers travel
and throughout his life he followed his ideal, which was to
translate into the language of music, human feelings and
ideas.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='c016'>Musicke in Merrie England</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>You will recall how far away England was in the 16th
century from Rome, the Pope, and the other nations.
Not that it has been pushed any nearer now, but the radio,
the aeroplane and the steamship have made it seem closer.
In the 16th century it took a long time to reach the people
of the continent, and for this reason England seemed to
many to have little musical influence, but in reality it had
much for it was forced to develop what it found at home.</p>

<p class='c008'>About 1420, John Dunstable wrote beautiful motets,
canzonas and other secular music in the contrapuntal style
of his period. He is supposed to have held a post in the
Chapel Royal, founded during the reign of Henry IV, and
to have taken part in the musical services held to celebrate
Henry’s victories in France.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came the War of the Roses between the Houses of
York and Lancaster, and musical composition in England
was checked for the sake of war-making. Yet, the Chapel
Royal was maintained and the universities gave degrees to
students of music. Judging from the number of singing
guilds and cathedral choirs, and from the amount of singing
and organ playing, music, even in spite of war, seemed to
have its innings.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the 16th century England made such strides forward
that she holds a high place in the growth of music. England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>loved the keyboard instruments such as the virginal,
and in this century, developed her own way of making a
delightful combination of polyphony and harmony with the
new music for the Protestant Church service.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bluff Prince Hal</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Right here came the Reformation of the English Church
under Henry VIII of the six wives. In 1535 he wanted
to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to marry
Anne Boleyn, her lady in waiting, which the Pope would
not permit him to do, as the Roman Catholic Church prohibits
divorce. So, like Germany and Switzerland, England
cut herself off from the Pope and founded the English or
Anglican Church with the King as its head. You can
imagine the excitement this caused, can’t you? People
lost their heads in very truth, for what they thought right
and religious, some of the rulers called sacrilegious and
heretical.</p>

<p class='c008'>Breaking away from the Church of Rome gave English
music a great push forward, for, the Mass (the musical setting
of the main part of the service), the motet (the particular
lines of the particular day) and the plain song
(which ministers intoned), were discontinued, and for these
were substituted, after Henry VIII’s reign, the Church
“Services” founded on the Elizabethan Prayer book. On
this book, still in use, the new music was written and included
such compositions as would fit this Liturgy (prayers),
the Litany, Creed, Psalms, Canticles (line verses), and the
Communion, the Plain Song, Versicles and Responses.
Then, too, came hymn tunes and anthems. Among the
composers of these in the Elizabethan reign were John
Shepherd, John Marbeck, Robert Whyte, Richard Farrant,
William Byrd and John Bull.</p>

<p class='c008'>But let us go back to Bluff Prince Hal (Henry VIII),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>who was good to music. Not only did he love it, but he
played and composed himself. One of his pieces is called
<cite>The King’s Balade</cite>, or <cite>Passetyme with Goode Companie</cite> and
the pastimes of this monarch were many. Read this list,
set down by one who knew him: “He spent his time in
shooting, singing, dancing, wrestling, casting of the bar,
playing at the recorders (a reed instrument), flute, virginals
(the English spinet) in setting songs and making ballads.”
So with eating and sleeping and attending to affairs of state
and to his many wives as they came along, he must have
had plenty to do! How many kings and governors today
write music as a “passetyme”?</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1526 he had a band of players, says Edmundstoune
Duncan in his <cite>Story of Minstrelsy</cite>, “composed of fifteen
trumpets, three lutes, three rebecks, one harp, two viols, ten
sackbuts, a fife, and four drumslades”; a few years later a
trumpet, a lute, three minstrels, and a player of the virginals
were added. (A rebeck is an early form of violin; a sackbut
is a reed instrument with a sliding piece such as we have today
in the trombone; the drumslade is an old word for
drum.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne Boleyn, second of King Henry’s many wives, loved
music and dancing, and she too tried her hand at composing,
to which fact her <cite>O death, rocke me on slepe</cite> is proof. It is
said that “she doated on the compositions of Josquin and
Mouton,” and that she made collections of them for herself
and her companions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up to this time there was no English Bible and only Latin
and Greek versions were used. The Church did not consider
it proper for the common people to read the Scriptures.
The Priests wanted to read and interpret it to them
instead. You remember, too, one of the reasons that the
Reformation took place in Germany was because Luther
wanted to let the people think for themselves, read their
Bible, and choose their own ways of worshipping and interpreting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>it. The same feeling crept into England, and William
Tyndale made the first English Translation of the
New Testament (1538). Soon the Psalms were translated
and set to music to any air from a jig to a French
dance tune! The gayer the air the more popular the Psalm!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chained Libraries</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Because the Protestants did not want anything left that
had been part of the old religion in England, a rather dreadful
thing happened. The monasteries were either destroyed
or their libraries and organizations were discontinued.
On account of this, many fine manuscripts of
music and poetry were lost, for as you know, the monks
copied out, with much effort, the literature of their day,
and these painstaking glorious bits of hand work were kept
in the monasteries.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are today four chained libraries in England, two of
which are at Hereford, the old city that holds yearly musical
festivals of the “Three Choirs.” The books are on the
old chains and may be taken down and read on the desk
below the shelves, as they were hundreds of years ago!
Here they are, in the cloisters, a great collection of treasures
beyond price, just as the medieval scholars read them in
days when books were the costliest of luxuries, three
hundred volumes dating back to the 12th century. The
earliest manuscript is the <cite>Anglo Saxon Gospels</cite> which was
written about 800 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> One of the greatest treasures is a
Breviary (prayer book) with music (1280)—the plain-song
notation as clear and as easy to read as modern print.</p>

<p class='c008'>As something had to take the place of monasteries, the
universities became the centers for study and the cultivation
of music. As far back as 866, King Alfred founded the
first chair of music at Oxford! Do you remember that this
was the time of the bards and minstrels? We do not seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>very old in America, when we think of a college with a
chair of music eleven hundred years ago!</p>

<p class='c008'>Before the printers were expelled from England, Wynken
de Worde, printed the first song book (1530) which contained
pieces by men important at the time: Cornyshe,
Pygot, Gwinneth, Robert Jones, Dr. Cooper, and Fayrfax.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Music for the New Church</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>As the kingdom changed its king at the death of each
monarch, the country swayed from Catholicism to Protestantism
and back again, and many a poet and musician lost
his head or was burnt at the stake because he wrote for the
Protestant Church. In the case of Marbeck who had made
music for the <cite>Book of Common Prayer</cite>, he just escaped death
for the crime of writing a <cite>Bible</cite> concordance (an index)!</p>

<p class='c008'>Before Wynken de Worde’s song book came out, William
Caxton, the great printer, published a book called
<cite>Polychronicon</cite> by Higden. In this, was an account of
Pythagoras and his discovery of tone relations (Chapter
IV); this proves the great interest in England for the
science, as well as the art, of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Frederick J. Crowest’s book, <cite>The Story of the Art of
Music</cite>, he tells very simply the state of music in England at
this time:</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the adventurous Henry VIII plunged into and
consummated (completed) the reformation scheme, it was
at the expense of considerable inconvenience to musicians
obliged, perforce, to change their musical manners as well
as their faith. In double quick time the old ecclesiastical
(church) music had to be cast aside, and new church music
substituted.... This meant pangs and hardships to
the musicians, possibly not too industrious, accustomed to
the old state of things. Simplicity, too, was the order, a
change that must have made musicians shudder when they,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>like others before them, from the time of Okeghem, had regarded
the Mass as the natural and orthodox (correct)
vehicle for the display of the contrapuntal miracles they
wrought.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the Mass became the “Service,” and the motet was
turned into the “Anthem,” which we still use in our
churches. Most of the famous composers of the 16th and
17th centuries in England wrote for the new Anglican or
Protestant Church, and made the new music lovely indeed.
Many of them were organists or singers in the Chapel
Royal, so they had been well prepared for their work.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make this new music different from the old, the writers
were ordered to fit every syllable with a chord (in the
harmonic style). In the old counterpoint, of course, the
words were somewhat blurred. These experiments with
chords did much to free music for all time.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the earliest of the church composers is Thomas
Tallis (about 1520–1585), a “Gentleman of the Chapel
Royal” and father of English cathedral music. Through
his long career, Tallis followed the different religions of the
rulers from Henry VIII to Elizabeth, writing Catholic music
or Protestant as was needed. You see he liked his head,
so he changed his music with each new monarch. He, like
some of the composers of the Netherlands school, wrote a
motet for forty voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shared with his pupil, William Byrd, the post of organist
of the Chapel Royal, and together they opened a shop
“to print and sell music, also to rule, print and sell music
paper for twenty-one years” under a patent granted by
Queen Elizabeth to them only. How successful the two
composers were in the publishing business is not stated, but
at least they could publish as many of their own works as
they cared to! After Tallis’ death, in 1585, for a while
Byrd ran the shop alone, and published a collection of
<cite>Psalms, Sonets, and Songs of Sadness and Pietie</cite>. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>was written “Eight reasons briefly set down by the Author
(Byrd) to persuade every one to learn to sing” to which
he added:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Since singing is so goode a thing</div>
      <div class='line'>I wish all men would learne to sing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Famous Old Music Collections</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>England was the land of famous music collections in the
16th and 17th centuries. The first of these by Byrd was a
book of Italian Madrigals with English words, <cite><span lang="it">Musica
Transalpina</span></cite>, (Music from across the Alps). The entire
title was (Don’t laugh!): “<cite><span lang="it">Musica Transalpina</span></cite>; Madrigals
translated of foure, five, and sixe parts, chosen out of
diuers excellent Authors, with the first and second part of
<cite>La Virginella</cite>, made by Maister Byrd vpon two Stanz’s
of Ariosto and brought to speak English with the rest. Published
by N. Yonge, in fauer of such as take pleasure in
Musick of voices. Imprinted at London by Thomas Easy,
the assigne of William Byrd, 1588. <cite><span lang="la">Cum Privilegio Regise
Maiestatis</span></cite> (With permission of her Royal Majesty).” A
long title and one that would not make a book a “bestseller”
today! Do notice how they mixed u’s and v’s and
put in e’s where you least expect them!</p>

<p class='c008'>There were fifty-seven madrigals in the long titled collection
including the two by “Maister Byrd”; the others
were by the Italian and Netherland madrigal writers, such
as Palestrina, Orlandus Lassus and Ferabosco, a composer
of masques and madrigals, who lived for years in
England.</p>

<p class='c008'>Byrd’s compositions in this work mark the beginning of
the great English school of madrigals, which were so lovely
that this period (1560 to 1650) was called the “Golden
Age.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Golden Age of Madrigals</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Now the madrigal becomes the great English contribution
to music. It was a part-song in free contrapuntal
style and the music was made to fit the words. For the
first time, secular music was held in great honor, and prepared
the way for arias, dramatic solos and original melodies.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Byrd and Edwards, came other madrigal writers:
Thomas Morley, John Dowland, George Kirby, Thomas
Ford, Thomas Ravenscroft, Orlando Gibbons and others.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the madrigal was being written in England and
elsewhere, the part-song was being written in Germany. It
was the companion of the chorale, as the madrigal was the
secular partner of the motet. The chorale was written for
part singing, had a continuous melody and the same air
was used for all stanzas. In this the church modes were
never used, yet, it is baffling sometimes to tell a madrigal
from a part-song.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Italy the <em>villanella</em>, or <em>villota</em> is a part-song. In France
it was the <em>chanson</em>, in England it was the madrigal or the
<em>glee</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>The Triumphs of Oriana</span>”</h4>

<p class='c018'>Monarchs, besides ruling the country, inspired poets and
composers from earliest times, and Queen Elizabeth was no
exception. <cite>The Triumphs of Oriana</cite> is a collection of
madrigals by many English composers in praise of Queen
Elizabeth, made by Thomas Morley. Because William
Byrd does not appear in it, it looks as if this collection had
been published to show Byrd that the English could write
good madrigals, too. Anyhow, it definitely proves that
the English madrigals are as charming as the French,
Italian or Flemish. There is a copy of the original edition
in the British Museum.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Maister Byrd Gives Advice</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In 1611, an important work of Byrd’s appeared called
<cite>Psalms, Songs and Sonets: some solemne, others joyfull,
framed to the life of the words: Fit for Voyces or Viols</cite>. In
the dedication, the composer gives this good advice: “Onely
this I desire; that you will be but as carefull to heare them
well expressed, as I have beene both in the composing and
correcting of them. Otherwise the best Song that euer was
made will seeme harsh and vnpleasant.... Besides a
song that is well and artificially made cannot be well perceived
nor vnderstood at the first hearing, but the oftner
you shall heare it, the better cause of liking it you will discouer;
and commonly the Song is best esteemed with which
our eares are best acquainted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Over the door of the music hall in Oxford University, is a
canon (or round) for three voices, said to have been written
by William Byrd. Some day, if you have not already seen
it, you will have the thrilling experience of visiting the
venerable college, and you may remember to look for this
canon.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ladies of the Realm Play Virginals</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>As today we consider no home complete without a piano
(or pianoforte which is its real name), so in the 16th and 17th
centuries we would have found a little key board instrument
so small that it could easily be swallowed whole by
one of our grand pianos, and you would never know where
it had disappeared! It was known by several names,—spinet,
clavecin, and virginal or virginals. Another instrument
belonging to the same family and period is the
harpsichord, which is more like our grand piano in shape.
But later we will tell you more of the pianoforte’s family
tree, and of its tiny but important grand-parent.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was quite the proper thing for all the ladies of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>realm to play the virginals, and the Queens, Mary, Elizabeth,
and Mary, Queen of Scots, were excellent performers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The very first music printed for the virginals in England
was called <cite>Parthenia</cite> (from the Greek word Parthenos,
meaning unmarried woman or virgin). The printed title
also tells us that it was “composed by three famous masters,
William Byrd, Dr. John Bull and Orlando Gibbons
Gentilmen of his Majesties most illustrious Chappell.”
There are twenty-one pieces from the old dances which
formed the Suites, of which you will soon hear,—Preludiums,
Pavanes, Galiardes, a Fantasia, and one <cite>The Queene’s
Command</cite>. It was published in 1611, on staves of six lines,
instead of five, as we use, and it was the first musical work
engraved on copper plates!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>More Famous Collections</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Another most valuable collection was for many years
called <cite>Queen Elizabeth’s Virginal Book</cite>, but is now the
<cite>Fitzwilliam Virginal Book</cite>, and the original manuscript is
in the Fitzwilliam museum at Cambridge. It was supposed
to have been “Good Queen Bess’” book, but it was
not, as some of its compositions were composed after her
death. It is not known who copied 220 pages of music, but
it may have been a wealthy Roman Catholic, Francis
Tregian, who spent twenty-four years in prison on account
of his religious faith. This name, abbreviated or in initials,
is found in several places in the manuscript. An edition
in our notation has been made by J. A. Fuller Maitland and
W. Barclay Squire. Many of the old songs of English minstrelsy
are found among the numbers, and they were arranged
for the instrument by the famous composers of that
day. There are also original compositions as well as
“ayres” and variations. Among the composers we find
Dr. John Bull, Thomas Morley, William Byrd, Orlando
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Gibbons, Giles Farnaby, Richard Farnaby, Thomas Tallis,
Jan Sweelinck, the Dutch organist, and many others.
Here are some of the quaint titles: <cite>St. Thomas’ Wake</cite>,
<cite>King’s Hunt</cite>, <cite>The Carman’s Whistle</cite>, <cite>The Hunt’s Up</cite>, <cite>Sellonger’s
Round</cite>, <cite>Fortune My Foe</cite>, <cite>Pawles Warfe</cite>, <cite>Go from My
Window</cite>, <cite>Bonny Sweet Robin</cite>, besides many Pavanes,
Galiardes, Fantasias, and Preludiums.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is also a collection of Byrd’s virginal music called
<cite>My Lady Nevell’s Booke</cite>. Lady Nevell may have been a
pupil of Byrd. There are two collections of this same kind
at Buckingham Palace, the home of the King of England,—<cite>Will
Forster’s Virginal Book</cite> and <cite>Benjamin Cosyn’s Virginal
Book</cite>. In the index of the latter, we read: “A table
of these Lessons following made and sett forth by Ben Cos.”
In all, he copied more than 90 compositions!</p>

<p class='c008'>Later came John Playford, music publisher, whose first
musical publication, <cite>The English Dancing-Master</cite> (1650),
contains almost a hundred old folk tunes. <cite>Select Musical
Ayres</cite> appeared three years later, and is a typical 17th century
song collection of first-class poems by Jonson, Dryden
and others set to music by well-known composers. His
book on the theory of music, used for almost a century,
contained “lessons” for the viol, the cithern and flageolet.
His <cite>Dancing Master</cite>, a collection of airs for violin for country
dances, has brought to us many popular ballad tunes
and dance airs of the period.</p>

<p class='c008'>In these collections we often find the names <em>Fancies</em>,
<em>Fantazia</em>, or <em>Fantasies</em>, a type of composition that grew out
of the madrigal and led to the sonata. It was the name
given to the first compositions for instruments alone like
the <i><span lang="it">ricercari</span></i> of the Italians, which were original compositions
and not written on a given subject (called in England
“ground”), or on a folk song. The <em>Fancies</em> were sometimes
written for the virginal, and sometimes for groups of instruments
such as a “chest of viols” or even five cornets(!).</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Chest of Viols</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Chest of Viols” may sound queer to you, but it isn’t!
It was the custom in England at that time for people to
have collections of instruments in or out of chests. So,
when callers came they could play the viol, instead, probably
of bridge! You can read about these interesting old
days in Samuel Pepys’ <cite>Diary</cite>. He played the lute, the
viol, the theorbo, the flageolet, the recorder (a kind of flute)
and the virginal, and he was the proud owner of a chest of
viols. He always carried his little flageolet with him in his
pocket, and he says that while he was waiting in a tavern
for a dish of poached eggs, he played his flageolet, also that
he remained in the garden late playing the flageolet in the
moonlight. (Poetic Pepys!)</p>

<p class='c008'>Thomas Morley, Byrd’s pupil, who was made a partner
in the publishing house after Tallis’s death, wrote his madrigals
for virginal, and a collection called <cite>First Book of Consort
Lessons for Six Instruments, Lute, Pandora, Cittern</cite> (an
old English form of guitar), <cite>Bass Viol, Flute, and Treble
Viol</cite>, and much sacred music. He also wrote a <cite>Plaine
and Easie Introduction to Practical Musick</cite>, a book of great
value and interest to musicians for the last three centuries,
for it is a mirror of his time and of his fellow
composers.</p>

<p class='c008'>He tells of a gentleman, who, after dinner, was asked by
his hostess to sing from the music she gave him. It was
the custom in England to bring out the music books after
dinner and for the guests to play and sing, as we wind up
our graphophones and switch on the radio. The gentleman
stammeringly declared that he could not sing at sight
and “everyone began to wonder; yea, some whispered to
others, demanding how he was brought up.” He was so
ashamed of his ignorance that he immediately took music
lessons to remedy his woeful lack of culture. This proves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>that musical education was not looked upon as a luxury but
a necessity in the 17th century.</p>

<p class='c008'>Truly, it was a musical era, this time of Morley and Byrd!
Fancy playing, while waiting for the barber, the viol, flute,
lute, cittern, or virginal left for that purpose. Yet what
would our dentist do today if he had to listen to a saxophone
and jazz chorus from his waiting room? In those
days, too, there was always a bass viol left in a drawing-room
for the guest, to pass the time, waiting for the host to
appear. Think of all the practising you could do waiting
for the busy dentist or eternally late hostess!</p>

<p class='c008'>The children of people who were poor, were taught music
to make them fit to be “servants, apprentices or husbandmen.”
Laneham, a groom who had been brought up in
the royal stable, was advanced to the post of guarding the
door of the council chamber and this is how he described
his qualifications for the job: “Sometimes I foot it with
dancing; now with my gittern, and else my cittern, then at
the virginals (ye know nothing comes amiss to me); then
carol I up a song withal; that by-and-by they come flocking
about me like bees to honey; and ever they cry, ‘Another,
good Laneham, another!’” (From <cite>The Story of Minstrelsy</cite>
by Edmundstoune Duncan.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare and Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>This was the day in which Shakespeare lived, and from his
plays we get a very good idea of the popular music of his
time, for he used bits of folk songs and old ballads. <cite>It was a
Lover and his Lass</cite> from <cite>As You Like It</cite> was set to music by
Thomas Morley, and is one of the few songs written to
Shakespeare’s words in his own day that has come down to
us. In <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> there is <cite>O Mistress Mine</cite>, <cite>Hold thy
Peace</cite>, <cite>Peg-a-Ramsey</cite>, <cite>O, London is a Fine Town</cite>, <cite>Three
Merry Men be We</cite>, and the Clown’s song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Hey! Robin, jolly Robin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tell me how thy lady does, etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>, <cite>As You Like It</cite>, <cite>The Tempest</cite>,
<cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, <cite>Hamlet</cite>, <cite>Othello</cite> are folk songs that are
very well known and loved. Two songs from <cite>The Tempest</cite>,
<cite>Where the Bee Sucks</cite> and <cite>Full Fathoms Five</cite>, were set to
music by a composer, Robert Johnson, who lived at the
same time as Shakespeare, but was not as famous as
Morley, who also lived then. <cite>O, Willow, Willow</cite>, sung by
Desdemona in <cite>Othello</cite> is one of the most beautiful and saddest
folk songs we know.</p>

<p class='c008'>One Shakespeare song has been made famous by the
beautiful music which the great German song writer,
Schubert, wrote to it. It is from <cite>Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite>
and is called <cite>Who is Sylvia?</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the English composers of the 17th and 18th
centuries such as Henry Purcell and Dr. Arne made music
for the Shakespeare songs because they were so lovely and
so well written that they almost sang themselves; this we
call lyric verse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thomas Weelkes (1575?–1623) whose madrigals were included
in <cite>The Triumphs of Oriana</cite>, also wrote many <cite>Fancies
for Strings</cite> which were the ancestors of the string quartets,
the highest type of music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Cryes of London</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Several composers of this period, Thomas Weelkes,
Orlando Gibbons (1583–1625) and Richard Deering (1580?–1630)
wrote pieces using the old “Cryes of London” as
their themes. Each trade had its own song, and the street
pedlars used these tunes just as the fruit vendors, old-clothes
men, and flower vendors cry their wares in our
streets today. There is this difference, however; the street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>cries of today are mere noise, while the old “Cryes of London”
were interesting and usually beautiful songs. <cite>Cherry
Ripe</cite> is one of them, and Campion used it in 1617 in his famous
old song, <cite>There is a Garden in Her Face</cite>. Some of the
composers made rounds and catches based on the “Cryes,”
and Weelkes in his <cite>Humorous Fancy</cite> used the songs of the
chimney-sweep, the bellows-mender, and the vendors of
fruit, fish and vegetables. In telling about this “fancy,”
Frederick Bridge, a British composer and professor of
music in Gresham College, says: “The Fancy at one point
leaves its regular course, and for a few bars a delightful
dance tune is introduced, to the words, whatever they mean,
‘Twincledowne Tavye.’ It is as if the vendors of fish, fruit
and vegetables met in the street and had a bit of a frolic
together.” Bridge also says that he thinks all lovers of
Shakespeare will be glad to make the acquaintance of the
music of the “Cryes of London” which saluted the poet’s
ears in his daily walk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Orlando Gibbons called his composition on the “cryes,”
a <cite>Burlesque Madrigal</cite>, and beside the cries, he has used in
one of the inner parts for viol, an old plain-song melody, a
form used very often by the Italian madrigalists of the 16th
century. Richard Deering’s <cite>Humorous Fancy</cite>, <cite>The Cryes
of London</cite>, is the most elaborate of the three we have mentioned,
having among many other tradesmen’s songs, those
of the rat-catcher (this makes us think of Browning’s <cite>Pied
Piper of Hamelin</cite>), the tooth-drawer, and the vendor of
garlic.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Some Famous Composers</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Orlando Gibbons was one of the composers of <cite>Parthenia</cite>.
But he is famous as a composer of sacred music, in fact, he is
looked upon as the greatest composer of the English contrapuntal
school. His anthems are still sung in the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Cathedrals, and one of them made for James I, was
sung, in part, at the coronations of both Edward VII and
George V, and is now called the <cite>Abbey Amen</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gibbons, Byrd and Bull were very fine organists. Gibbons
was organist of Westminster Abbey, and we are told
by a writer of his own day that “the organ was touched by
the best finger of that age, Mr. Orlando Gibbons.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. John Bull (1563–1628) was brought up, as were
many of the young English musicians, as one of the “Children
of the Chapel Royal Choir.” Later he became organist
and player to King James I. Bull left England, entered the
service of a Belgian archduke, was organist at the Antwerp
Cathedral, and when he died in 1628, he was buried there.
In the University of Oxford, where Bull took his degree as
Doctor of Music, is his portrait around which is written:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Bull by force in field doth rayne</div>
      <div class='line'>But Bull by skill good-will doth gaine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>John Milton, father of the great poet, was an important
composer of this period. It is well known that his famous
son was very fond of music, was a good musician himself,
and had many friends among these composers and musicians.</p>

<p class='c008'>The music for Milton’s famous Masque, <cite>Comus</cite>, was
written by Henry Lawes (1595–1662) and was first produced
in 1635. Lawes studied with an English composer
named John Cooper who lived for so many years in Italy,
that his name was translated into Giovanni Coperario. He
turned the thoughts of his pupil to composing music for
the stage, instead of church music. It looks as if Milton
had been a pupil of Lawes, and had written <cite>Comus</cite> specially
for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lawes played a very amusing joke upon the concert-goers.
At that time, as now, many thought that the music
of other countries, and songs in foreign languages were better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>than their own. While Lawes himself knew the Italian
music very well, he was eager to compose music that should
be truly English. In the preface to his <cite>Book of Ayres</cite> he
confessed: “This present generation is so sated with
what’s native, that nothing takes their ears but what’s
sung in a language which (commonly) they understand as
little as they do the music. And to make them a little
sensible of this ridiculous humor, I took a Table or Index
of old Italian Songs and this <em>Index</em> (<em>which read together
made a strange medley of nonsense</em>) <em>I set to a varyed Ayre,
and gave out that it came from Italy, whereby it has passed
for a rare Italian song</em>.” (Quoted from Bridge’s <cite>Twelve
Good Musicians</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Lawes helped to compose a work that is looked upon as
the first English opera, <cite>The Siege of Rhodes</cite>. This was
played during the time of Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth,
and in this piece for the first time in England,
women appeared upon the stage.</p>

<p class='c008'>A year after the Commonwealth was overthrown, Henry
Lawes died and was buried in Westminster Abbey, but the
spot where his body lies is not known.</p>

<p class='c008'>From 1641 to 1660, music must have had a hard time for
this was the period of the Commonwealth, when the country
was going through all the horrors of civil war, and
Cromwell’s soldiers destroyed many things of great artistic
value, that could never be replaced. Among them were
the works of art found in the wonderful old English cathedrals,
including organs and musical manuscripts. At
Westminster Abbey, the Roundheads (the name given to
Oliver Cromwell’s soldiers) “brake down the organs for
pots of ale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Matthew Locke (1630?–1677) is looked upon as the
“Father of English Opera.” He wrote the music for <cite>Psyche</cite>
and <cite>The Tempest</cite> (1673). Another Shakespeare play to
which Locke wrote the music was <cite>Macbeth</cite>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Captain Cooke’s Choir Boys</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Immediately after the Restoration, the Chapel Royal
Choir was reorganized. For centuries it had been the
great school of music for the sons of both rich and poor,
and had produced nearly all the English musicians. Captain
Henry Cooke, the first chapel master of the new choir,
seems to have picked out unusually gifted children, some
of whom wrote anthems while they were still in the Choir,
and afterwards became very famous composers, among
them John Blow, Pelham Humphrey and the great Henry
Purcell. The Captain evidently knew how to train his boys!</p>

<p class='c008'>Pelham Humphrey, having attracted the attention of the
King, was sent to Paris to study with the famous opera
composer, Lully. The effect of this study was felt in English
music, as Humphrey was Purcell’s master at the
Chapel Royal, after the death of the good Captain Cooke,
and he introduced his new ideas to his talented little choir
boys and musical friends. Samuel Pepys says that the
visit to Paris made a snob of “little” Pelham Humphrey:
“He is an absolute <i><span lang="fr">Monsieur</span></i>, full of form and confidence
and vanity, and disparages everything and everybody’s
skill but his own. But to hear how he laughs at all the
King’s Musick here,&#160;... that they cannot keep time nor
tune nor understand anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. John Blow (1648–1708) composed Anthems while
still a choir boy, and at twenty-one was organist of Westminster
Abbey. In 1674 he was Master of the Children of
the Chapel Royal, and became its organist as well, without
giving up his post at Westminster. During part of the
time Purcell was at Westminster, and Blow was Almoner
and Master of the choristers in St. Paul’s Cathedral.
Think of filling three of the greatest positions in musical
London at the same time! He wrote an Anthem, <cite>I was
Glad</cite>, for the opening of St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1697.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>He wrote many church compositions, masques, and pieces
for harpsichord.</p>

<p class='c008'>Purcell called him “one of the greatest masters in the
world.” Like Monteverde, he tried out new effects in
harmony and made new combinations which have since been
called “crude,” but were signs of a musical daring and
understanding that belong only to very gifted musicians.</p>

<p class='c008'>He died in 1708 and is buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Maister Purcell</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The last of the great 17th century English composers,
and the greatest of them all, is Henry Purcell (1658–1695).
His father was a well-known musician, and the uncle, who
brought him up, was also a musician, so the young boy
heard much music in his own home, and no doubt knew
many composers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Frederick Bridge in <cite>Twelve Good Musicians</cite> tells us
that the Purcell family came from Tipperary in Ireland and
that Henry’s father and uncle were Gentlemen in the
Chapel Royal in London. Henry began his music studies
at the age of six, for he, too, was one of “Captain Cooke’s
boys,” and when he was twelve years old, “Maister Purcell”
wrote a composition in honor of “His Majestie’s
Birthday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young Purcell, sometimes called the “English
Mozart,” gained much from Pelham Humphrey who told
him of Lully in France. After Humphrey’s early death
(he was only twenty-seven), Purcell studied with Dr. Blow,
and the two musicians were devoted comrades. Their
tombs lie close together near the old entrance of the organ
loft, where they must have spent many hours of their
lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>Matthew Locke was also a friend of Purcell’s, and probably
did much to interest the young composer in the drama,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>for in spite of his early church training, Purcell’s greatest
offering to English music was his opera writing. While
Purcell’s are not operas in our sense of the word, they are
the nearest thing to them that England had, before the
Italians came with theirs in the 18th century. He wrote
music to masques and plays, several of which were even
called operas, yet only one really was an opera. Purcell’s
music “was so far in advance of anything of the sort known
in any part of Europe in his day, in point of dramatic and
musical freedom and scenic quality, that one can only regret
his early death’s preventing his taking to opera writing
on a larger scale.” (W. F. Apthorp.) Among the things
he put to music were the plays of Dryden and of Beaumont
and Fletcher.</p>

<p class='c008'>Purcell was one of the first English composers to use
Italian musical terms, like <em>adagio</em>, <i><span lang="it">presto</span></i>, <i><span lang="es">largo</span></i>, etc. He
was also one of the first composers to write compositions of
three or four movements for two violins, ’cello and basso
continuo, a part written for harpsichord or sometimes
organ as an accompaniment to the other instruments.
The name of this style of composition also came from the
Italian, and was called <em>Sonata</em>. The first sonatas were composed
by Italians. The word Sonata comes from an Italian
word <i><span lang="it">suonare</span></i> which means to sound, and was first given to
works for instruments. Another form of composition is
the Cantata, from <i><span lang="it">cantare</span></i> which means to sing. It is a
vocal composition with accompaniment of instruments, a
direct descendant of the motet and madrigal, and of the
early oratorios.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Toccata, too, comes from the Italian <i><span lang="it">toccare</span></i>, meaning
to touch, and was originally a work for instruments with
keyboards. The Italian language gave us our musical
names and terms, because Italian music was the model of
what good music should be, and England, France and Germany
copied Italian ways of composing. Everyone uses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the Italian terms for musical expressions so that all nationalities
can understand them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Purcell was only 17 years old, he composed an
opera to be played by young ladies in a boarding school.
This was <cite>Dido and Æneas</cite>, and it is so good that few writers
on musical subjects believe that it was written in his youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In every branch of composition in which Purcell wrote, he
excelled. His church music is the finest of his day, his
chamber music and his operas are looked upon as works of
genius. In fact, he is still considered the most gifted of all
English composers.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was only 37 when he died, and was a very great loss to
the growth of English music.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='c016'>Dance Tunes Grow Up—Suites—Violin Makers of Cremona</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>In our range of musical mountains, we see just ahead of us
one of the mightiest giants of them all, Johann Sebastian
Bach, dwarfing everything around it and we must resist
the temptation of skipping all the smaller mountains, for
there is no musical aeroplane by means of which we can
fly across and land safely on Mt. Bach. This grand old
mountain, Bach, is such a tremendous landmark in the
growth of music, that when we reach it we realize that
everything that we have passed has been a journey of preparation.
Bach is not the only peak, for there are Mozart,
Haydn, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Brahms, Wagner
and others who stand out against the musical horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before coming to Bach, however, we must bridge over
the time when music was still in its youth in the 16th and
17th centuries, to when it became full grown and mature in
the 18th. Music has now come of age: it has perfected
scales, notation, and developed form and instruments; it is
ready to go into the world and take its place with painting,
sculpture, poetry, drama and architecture as a full grown
art!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Nothing through which music has passed has been lost,
but it has been built like the great Egyptian Pyramids by
adding one huge block on top of another. It has gone from
the noise of primitive man with his drum, to the attempts
of the savage to sing and to make crude instruments, to
the music of the ancient nations in their religious ceremonies
and entertainments, to the Arab singer who handed his
art to the western world through the troubadours, to the
people of all times and nations who danced and sang for
the joy of it. It passed from the Greek drama and music
schools where definite scales and modes were formed, to
the early Christian Church which kept it alive during the
Dark Ages and gradually invented ways to write it, and
later to the “Golden Age” of the Catholic Church. It had
seen the rise of schools and the perfection of the polyphonic
system give way to the recitative and the aria,
which in turn brought about opera, oratorio, and instrumental
music. It has seen counterpoint give way to
harmony, and yet the growth of music is not complete
and never will be, but constantly new forms will blossom
out of the old.</p>

<p class='c008'>The 15th and 16th centuries were vocal. The 17th was
instrumental and opened the way for so-called modern
music, that is, for Bach’s compositions and all that followed.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Birth of Chamber Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Gabrieli in the 16th century in Venice, sometimes wrote
madrigals for instruments instead of for voices, and he added
instruments to accompany the motets and masses (page
<a href='#Page_157'>157</a>); this led to composing works for groups of instruments
instead of playing madrigals that had been composed for
voices. The English often wrote on their compositions,
“fit for voices and for viols.” After they once started playing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the part songs on viols, the composers soon found out
that they could write more interesting and more difficult
things for instruments than they could for voices; this led
to the writing of very florid music for instruments alone.
This florid part-writing, not unlike the Gloss of the Arabs,
and the improvisations of the soloists in the early Catholic
Church, soon became so overloaded with trills, fancy turns
and runs that it had to be reformed again.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the 17th century, the lute, the popular instrument of
the court and the home for so many years, even centuries,
suddenly found its rival in the little keyboard instrument
called the <em>spinet</em> and <em>virginal</em> in England, and the <i><span lang="fr">clavecin</span></i>
in France. In Italy and France, as in England, there
were famous performers and composers for these instruments,
and many volumes of charming music were written
for it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dance Tunes Grow up Into Suites</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the first requirements of art works of all kinds
is contrast. The line and the curve are found in primitive
art, light must have shadow, one wing of a building must
have another to balance it, and a slow serious piece of music
is usually followed by a gay one for contrast. The Arabs
understood this law of contrast, for in their ancient songs
we find the seed of a form that has been most important in
the growth of music. They made little suites by putting
two, three, four or more songs together; each song had its
mode, and one would be slow and sad, and the next fast
and gay. The principal music of the 17th century was the
Suite, a group of pieces which had grown out of the old
folk dances. (Chapter IX.) The 17th century composers,
like the Arabs, feeling the need of contrast, strung several
of these dances together to form the Suite. So Suites were
written for clavecins and harpsichords, for violins alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and for organs, for groups of stringed instruments and other
chamber music combinations. Some of these dances were
in duple time, some in triple; some were slow and some were
fast; some were stately and some gay. The different pieces
forming a suite, had to be written in the same key. These
suites were known by different names in different countries,
such as <em>partitas</em>, <em>exercises</em>, <em>lessons</em>, <i><span lang="it">sonate da camera</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">ordres</span></i>.
In England the name <em>suite</em> was given to this form, then the
Germans adopted it, and later the great Bach wrote suites
which he also called <em>partitas</em>. In Italy, the suite was called
<i><span lang="la">sonata da camera</span></i> (chamber sonata) and <i><span lang="la">sonata da chiesa</span></i>
(church sonata) and out of all this have grown the very
important sonata, symphony and chamber music quartet,
trio, quintet, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here are some of the dance forms used in the suite:</p>

<p class='c008'>Allemande (duple time or measure: moderately slow),
Sarabande (triple time: slow, stately), Loure (duple time:
slow), Gavotte (duple time: moderately fast), Musette
(duple time: moderately fast), Bourrée (duple time: a little
faster than the Gavotte), Minuet (triple time: moderately
fast), Passepied (triple time: a fast minuet), Rigaudon
(duple time: slower than the Bourrée), Tambourin (duple
time: fast), Pavan (duple time: rather slow), Courante,
Corrente (triple time: fast), Chaconne (triple time: moderately
fast), Passacaglia (like Chaconne, but more stately)
and Gigue (sometimes duple and sometimes triple time:
very fast: almost always the last movement of a suite).</p>

<p class='c008'>The Italians of the 17th century wrote suites, and Italy
still held the place as leading the world in musical composition,
just as it had in the 15th and 16th. We find the
names of Frescobaldi, Michelangelo Rossi, Legrenzi,
Bononcini, Giovanni Battista Vitali, Alessandro Scarlatti
and his son Domenico, and going over into the seventeen-hundreds,
Niccolo Porpora, Padre Martini, Paradies, and
Baldassare Galuppi, whom we know through Robert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Browning’s poem, <cite>A Toccata of Galuppi’s</cite>. Most of these
names you will find on the concert programs of today.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>“Serious” Scarlatti and Opera Writers</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Alessandro Scarlatti (1659–1725) is one of the most important
Italian composers of the 17th century, and although
he did not have great success during his lifetime, his compositions
have outlived those of other writers, whose works
were popular during his day. He was called “serious
Scarlatti,” and it was probably the very seriousness with
which he looked upon his work that made him write without
seeking public approval. Besides composing pieces
for the spinet and harpsichord, and symphonies, sonatas,
suites and concertos for different instruments, he wrote 125
operas, and over 500 cantatas, oratorios and church music.
He was one of several Italians who continued the work of
the first opera writers. Francesco Cavalli (1599–1676),
Giacomo Carissimi (1603–1674), Luigi Rossi, Marc Antonio
Cesti (1628–1669), Francesco Provenzale (1610–1704),
Stradella (1645–1682), Caldara (1670–1736), Lotti
(1667–1740), Marcello (1686–1739), Leo (1694–1746), and
others carried the ideas of Scarlatti into the 18th century.
Many of these carried Italian opera into England, Germany
and France, where it became the model for <em>their</em> opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stradella is quite as famous for his romantic love story,
as he is for the operas he left. This made an interesting
libretto in the 19th century for a German opera writer,
Flotow, who was also the composer of the well-known opera
<cite>Martha</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>“<span lang="it">La Serva Padrona</span>” Points the Way</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710–1736), who died when
he was only twenty-six years old, was looked upon as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>genius, and in his early youth had written two works that
were models for many that followed, a <cite>Stabat Mater</cite> and
a comic opera, <cite><span lang="it">La Serva Padrona</span></cite>, which was played recently
in America under the title of <cite>The Mistress Maid</cite>. When
this little opera was performed in Paris (1752) it caused a
very famous musical quarrel known as the “war of the
buffoons.” (Page <a href='#Page_230'>230</a>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Jomelli (1714–1774), the composer of fifty-five operas,
was a Neapolitan but he lived in Germany for so many
years, that he had more influence on early German opera
than on the Italian.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the opera of this period, particularly the Italian, was
very loosely put together and was not opera as we have it
today. Later Gluck brought it to the point where it came
of age.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Metastasio—Maker of Opera Librettos</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>These writers of the 18th century used the librettos of a
poet and dramatist, Metastasio (1698–1782), who had a
strong influence in the development of opera not only in
his native Italy, but in other countries. He supplied
texts for 1200 operatic scores! He understood music so
well, that he was a great help to the composers who listened
with attention to his advice. His life covered practically
all of the 18th century.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A Celebrated Singing Teacher and Composer</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When you read of Haydn, you will see that he played
accompaniments and acted as valet to the eminent singing
teacher Niccolo Porpora (1686–1767). This famous Italian
had many pupils in the opera houses all over Europe, and
was considered the greatest singing teacher in the world.
One of his pupils in Dresden was the young princess Marie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Antoinette before she became Queen of France. Porpora
was a fine composer, and wrote many operas, cantatas,
masses, oratorios, and sonatas of which form he was one of
the inventors. Among his pupils were Haydn, Marcello,
Tartini, Leo, Galuppi, Padre Martini, Jomelli, Pergolesi,
Caffarelli and Farinelli. This list shows that he trained
composers as well as singers.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Violin Makers of Cremona</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Important changes, such as instrumental music coming
into fashion, do not happen without good reasons. We are
so accustomed to the violin, that we forget that there was a
time when it did not exist, but until about three centuries
ago, there was none. We are always eager to have new
pianos, for the old ones wear out, but with violins the older
they are, the better! But they must be masterpieces to
begin with. All the famous violinists of the day like
Kreisler, Elman, Heifetz, etc., have marvelous old violins
that cost fortunes, and most of them were made by the
violin makers of Cremona, a little town in northern Italy,
the birthplace of Monteverde.</p>

<p class='c008'>The troubadours played the accompaniments to their
songs on stringed instruments called <em>violes</em> or <i><span lang="fr">vielles</span></i>, which
were the grandparents of the violins. In the 15th century
bowed instruments were made similar in range to the human
voice; these were called <em>treble</em> or <i><span lang="la">discant viol</span></i>, <em>tenor viol</em>, <em>bass
viol</em> and the <em>double-bass</em>, and in England these went into
the “chest of viols” (Page <a href='#Page_198'>198</a>). Many improvements were
made in the shape, size and tone of the instruments and by
the middle of the 17th century the Italian makers were
ready to create violins, perfect of their kind, which have
never been surpassed. The secret of the tone of these instruments
is said to be in the varnish which the Cremona
makers used, the recipe of which has been lost, but we met a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>violin maker recently in Paris who had discovered it in an
old Italian book, and he has spent years in trying to reproduce
it. The old Italian varnish and the mellowing of the
wood with time are two reasons why age makes the old
violins better.</p>

<p class='c008'>For several centuries, practically all the lutes and the
viols that supplied Europe were made by colonies of instrument
makers who lived in Lombardy (North Italy) and
the Tyrol (South Austria). Two towns in Lombardy became
especially famous for their violins, Brescia in which
Gaspara di Salo and Maggini lived, and Cremona which was
the home of the Amati, Stradivari and Guarneri families.
In <cite>The Orchestra and Its Instruments</cite>, Esther Singleton says:
“It is thrilling to realize that in this little town, in three
workshops side by side, on the Piazza San Domenico, all
the great violins of the world were made and in friendly
competition by the three families.” This covered the
period from 1560 to 1760. These men worked together
with just one object in life,—to turn out of their shops the
most perfect instruments that could possibly be made!
With what care they selected the wood! How they worked
to make the tone of each instrument as beautiful as possible!
Now you will know when you hear of an Amati violin, or a
Stradivarius, a Guanerius or a Maggini, that they are worth
their weight in gold and are among the rarest art treasures
of the world. These were not the only violin makers in
Lombardy, for there were long lists of them, and there were
also many in the Tyrol. One of the most famous of these
was Stainer who lived at Innsbruck. “It is said that this
old maker used to walk through the wooded slopes of the
Tyrolean mountains with a hammer in his hand and that
he would knock the trunks of the trees and listen to the
vibrations. When he found a tree that suited him, he had
it cut down to use in making his instruments.” (Esther
Singleton.)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>These instrument makers made not only violins, but
also lutes, mandolins, guitars, violas, violoncellos, and
double-basses. The Italians were the first to develop the
last two. The ’cello, as we call the violoncello for short,
was the child of an instrument named the <i><span lang="it">viola da gamba</span></i>
(translated leg-viola because it was held against the leg),
which for many years was the most popular of all bowed
instruments. We do not find many examples of the instruments
even in museums for they were made over into ’cellos
when the latter came into fashion. There is one <em>viola da
gamba</em> in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, however, which
was imported from France by the Sisterhood of the General
Hospital in Montreal before the conquest of Canada, and
was used in the convent choir many years before there were
any organs and pianos in the New World. The first ’cello
to attract attention was made in 1691 by a famous wood
carver and presented to the Duke of Modena. A member
of the Amati family in the 16th century was the first to
turn the <i><span lang="it">viola da gamba</span></i> into a violoncello. The ’cello and
the double-bass were made more successfully by Bergonzi
than by the Cremona makers, although Maggini, Amati and
Galiano made very fine ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>The viola is a descendant of the <i><span lang="it">viola d’amore</span></i>. These
and the later violas, used in the string quartets, orchestras,
and as solo instruments, were made by a Tyrolese named
Gaspard Duiffaprugcar in the 16th century. His instruments
are marvelous works of art. In the back of one is a
riddle in Latin: can you guess the answer? “I was living
in the forest; the cruel axe killed me. Living, I was mute;
dead, I sing sweetly.” When madrigals and motets were
first played on stringed instruments, the principal melody
was given to the tenor viol, the ancestor of the viola,
even today called the alto or the tenor, but after the violin
came into general use, the viola was treated like a step-child,
for it is too large for a violin and too small for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>violoncello. We have Mozart to thank for discovering that
the viola had something beautiful and important to say as a
solo instrument especially in passages where he needed a
tender, sad or melancholy voice. You will read later that
Beethoven, too, loved the poor neglected viola. He,
Berlioz and Wagner used the instrument to great advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1572 Pope Pius V sent Charles IX, King of France, a
present of thirty-eight bowed instruments made by the
first Amati. During the French Revolution, the mob
broke into the palace at Versailles, and all but two violins
and a ’cello were destroyed! What a loss to art such destruction
was!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Showing Off the New Instruments</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>With this development of exquisite instruments, came the
desire to use them and to write new compositions to show
them off. These instruments gave unlimited possibilities
for technic and tone, and created the school of Italian
violinists and composers of the 17th and 18th centuries. If
polyphonic music had still been in the lead, the development
of solo instruments would have been impossible, but
in trying to find new forms, the first opera inventors had
broken the backbone of polyphony, and had replaced it
with monody, or single line melody. Then, too, folk dances
had taken the public fancy and had been made into suites,
which could be played on solo bowed instruments with
accompaniments, on spinets and organs, or on groups of
instruments. The <i><span lang="la">sonata da camera</span></i> was really a suite of
dances and was the first form used by these new composers
for violin. About the middle of the 17th century, instrumental
performances without any vocal music came to be a
part of the services of the Catholic Church for the priests
were quick to see in the violin playing, a refining influence.
Here the <i><span lang="la">sonata da camera</span></i> or “room sonata” was turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>into the more serious <i><span lang="la">sonata da chiesa</span></i> or “church sonata”
gradually losing its dance character, and thus became the
seed of the sonata form of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Giovanni Battista Vitali (1644–1692) is the first great
master of the violin sonata; after him, Torelli (1657–1716)
added a new and important kind of violin composition,—the
Concerto. He called his compositions, <cite>Concerti da
Camera</cite> and <cite><span lang="it">Concerti Grossi</span></cite>, which names and form were
used by Vivaldi, Corelli, Handel and Bach. This <cite>Concerto
Grosso</cite> was a <i><span lang="la">sonata da chiesa</span></i> accompanied not by a single
instrument as was the habit with the <i><span lang="la">sonata da chiesa</span></i> and
the <i><span lang="la">sonata da camera</span></i>, but by a group of bowed instruments
to which a lute, organ and, later, a harpsichord were added.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this time, all musicians were, as a matter of course,
violinists, just as today all great composers can play the
piano. One of the greatest of these composer-violinists was
Arcangelo Corelli (1653–1713), whose works are often
played by violinists of our own time, and have served as
models for composers. He was one of the first to try to
write music that should show off the beauty and possibilities
of the violin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “Golden Age” of the Italian violin composers dated
from 1720 to 1750, and was the time of Locatelli, Pugnani,
Nardini, Veracini, Tartini and Vivaldi who added oboes
and horns to the orchestral accompaniment of the <cite><span lang="it">Concerti
Grossi</span></cite>. Corelli and Vivaldi were the models used by the
German school of violinists who appeared about this time.
Tartini was the musical authority of his century, and no
violinist felt sure of his place as an artist until he had been
heard and approved by Tartini. He was the composer
of the famous piece called <cite>The Devil’s Trill</cite>. Although
Vivaldi was not looked upon with great esteem in his own
time, he was used as a model by Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Padre Martini, recognized by all Europe as the greatest
authority on musical subjects, lived in Bologna where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>was visited by such musicians as Grétry, Gluck, Mozart and
one of the sons of Bach. Padre, or Father, Martini was a
Franciscan monk, a fine composer, a learned historian, a
master of counterpoint, and the owner of a musical library
of 17,000 volumes! He helped everyone who sought him,
and was loved by the entire musical world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once a year a great music festival was held in Bologna by
the Philharmonic Society and new works by the Bolognese
composers were performed. One hundred musicians took
part in the orchestra and the choruses, and each composer
conducted his own work. It was an honor to be present at
this annual festival, and Italian and foreign musicians came
from all over Europe to attend it. Young composers
sometimes became famous over night here, for the critics
were all invited and serious decisions were made as to the
value of new music. Dr. Burney, a famous English musical
historian of the 18th century, tells of meeting Leopold
Mozart and his young son, Wolfgang Amadeus, at one
of these festivals. Through the kind scheming of Padre
Martini were they admitted!</p>

<p class='c008'>Rome, in the 18th century was still the great music center,
and guided the religious music of the world. It had wonderful
collections of old music which attracted students
from all over; it had seven or eight very famous theatres,
where <em>opera seria</em> and <i><span lang="it">opera buffa</span></i> were given. (Today we
call them grand opera and comic opera.) The Roman public
was very difficult to please and because of the severity of
their judgments, opera writers suffered every time their
new works had first performances. Just think how you
would feel if you had composed an opera, and by accident
had put in a melody that sounded something like one that
Mozart, Wagner, Puccini or Verdi had composed, if the
whole house should break into shouts of “Bravo, Mozart!”
or “Bravo, Wagner!” or “Bravo, Puccini!!” etc. This is
what used to happen in Rome, but no doubt it was a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>thing because it stopped a habit the composers had in those
days, of helping themselves to each other’s melodies.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Domenico Scarlatti</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>But here we must pause for a moment to tell you of the
life and work of Alessandro Scarlatti’s son, Domenico, who
was born in Naples in 1685, the same year as Bach and
Handel. When you recall how many operas the father
wrote, it seems queer that his son did not follow in his footsteps.
The truth is that he did write operas for the private
theatre of the Queen of Poland in Rome, and also sacred
music while he was chapel master of St. Peter’s, but he
became immortal as a composer of harpsichord music. In
the influence he had in the growing up of piano music, he
can be compared to Chopin and Liszt, and is a founder of
piano music style, an honor, which he shares with the
French Couperin and Rameau, his contemporaries. The
difference is that the two Frenchmen have a delicacy and
grace that recall their period of wigs and satins and laces,
while Scarlatti’s works have strength, vigor and daring that
take them out of any special period and place them beside
the great piano compositions of all time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scarlatti’s sonatas are sonatas in the Italian sense of a
<em>sound-piece</em>; they are not, like the suites, in several movements,
but each is in one movement, which forecasts the
modern sonata form with its two main contrasting themes
and development.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “serious Scarlatti” understood his son’s talent, for
he sent him at the age of 20 to Florence to a member of the
powerful de Medici family with this letter: “This son of
mine is an eagle whose wings are grown; he ought not to
stay idle in the nest, and I ought not to hinder his flight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Three years later Handel and Scarlatti met in Rome in
an organ and harpsichord competition, and while Handel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>won as organist, even Scarlatti declaring that he did not
know that such playing existed, no decision was made as to
which was the better harpsichord player. This contest
seems to have caused no hard feelings for the two young
men of the same age became devoted friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scarlatti had a trick of crossing his hands in his compositions.
Who does not remember with joy his first piece in
which he had to cross his hands? But sad to relate as he
grew old, he became so fat that he could no longer cross
hands with comfort, so in the last compositions the crossing
of hands is noticeably absent!</p>

<p class='c008'>It is hard to know where an inspiration is next coming
from, but wouldn’t you be surprised were you a composer,
if your pet cat presented you with a perfectly good theme?
This happened to Domenico Scarlatti! His cat walked
across the keyboard, and the composer used his musical
foot prints as the subject of a very fine fugue! Maybe
Zez Confrey’s <cite>Kitten on the Keys</cite> is a descendant of this
pussy’s piece.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Scarlattis were the last of the great Italian instrumental
composers. For two centuries Italy had been the
generous dispenser of culture, and like an unselfish mother
had sent her children out into the world to carry knowledge
and works to all the nations of Europe. The sun of Italy’s
greatness was setting just as it began to rise in Germany.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='c016'>Opera in France—Lully and Rameau—Clavecin and Harpsichord Composers</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>We left French Opera in 1600 when Henry IV married
Marie de’ Medici. Ballets which resembled the
English masques had been performed when Baif and his
friends had produced <cite><span lang="fr">Le Ballet Comique de la Reine</span></cite>, but no
real opera had yet been written in France. In 1645,
Cardinal Mazarin, the powerful Italian prime minister of
France, invited a company of Italian singers to give a performance
of Peri’s <cite>Euridice</cite> in Paris. The French did not
like the opera, as they said it sounded too much like plain
song and airs from the cloister, and yet it led to Abbé Perrin’s
writing a work in 1658 which he called the <cite>Pastoral</cite>,
and for which a composer named Cambert wrote the music.
The <cite>Pastoral</cite> was a very great success, and was repeated by
order of Louis XIV, King of France. Ten years later,
Louis gave Perrin and Cambert permission “to establish
throughout the kingdom academies of opera, or representations
with music in the French language after the manner
of those in Italy.” Their next work, <cite>Pomone</cite>, was the first
opera performed publicly in an opera house, built purposely
in Paris for them. The opera was so enthusiastically received,
that it ran nightly for eight months, and the crowds
were so great, that the police had to be called out. This
combination of poet and composer came to an end with
<cite>Pomone</cite>, and a new man acquired the right to give opera in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the new opera house. This man was Jean Baptiste Lully
or in Italian, Giovanni Battista Lulli (1632–1687).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Lully the King’s Favorite</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>You may hear that the first famous opera writer of
France had been a pastry cook or kitchen boy, but no matter
how humble his start in life, he rose to the highest social
position ever reached up to that time by a composer in
France. He became a great favorite of Louis XIV, he
was covered with titles and honors, he was on friendly
terms with all the nobility of the court, he was musical dictator
of the opera and in fact of all the musical happenings of
the court. The greatest literary geniuses of the period,
such as Molière, Racine, La Fontaine, Quinault, Corneille
and Boileau, worked with him when he wanted new librettos
for his operas. He paid dearly for all his privileges,
because his fellow composers were jealous of his genius and
his opportunities, and they lost no chance to blacken his
character.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lully was born in Florence, Italy, in 1632, but we can
tell you little or nothing of his parentage or of his childhood.
A monk taught him a little about music and how to
play the guitar. When he was about twelve years old, he
was picked up by the Duke de Guise who saw him with a
group of traveling comedians, and was so attracted by his
vivacity, his singing and talent for mimicry, that he took
him back to Paris, where he placed him in the household of
his cousin, Mlle. de Montpensier. In her memoirs, Mademoiselle
said that she had been studying Italian and had
asked her cousin to bring back from Tuscany where he
lived, a little Italian <i><span lang="fr">garçon de la Chambre</span></i>, a sort of personal
errand boy. However, his guitar playing and musical
gifts soon lifted him out of a servant’s position and he became
one of the musicians of the great lady’s household
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>playing at concerts, balls and in the ballets. He learned to
play the violin, and soon began to compose popular dances.
He remained a member of Mademoiselle’s household until
he was nineteen when he asked permission to leave her
service, as she had moved to the country, and he liked the
gay life of Paris better.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had no difficulty in attaching himself to the King’s
court, first as actor and dancer in the ballets, and soon as
“composer of instrumental music.” Louis XIV was only
fourteen years old, and was evidently highly entertained by
the capers of the young Italian who was willing to play any
rôle, dance any kind of a dance, or play the violin “divinely”
for his young monarch’s amusement. The King remained
Lully’s faithful friend always. Louis loved music,
and played the lute, the guitar, the harpsichord, and sang
very well. Feeling that he needed to know more, Lully
studied counterpoint, composition and learned to play the
harpsichord, and whatever he attempted musically, he acquired
without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1656, Lully composed music for a scene in a ballet,
<cite>Psyche</cite>, and from that time on, his compositions became the
most popular of any at court. Although he was born an
Italian, his music was French, and he even shared the
French dislike of the Italian opera. In spite of his love of
acting in the ballets, of dancing, and of courting social
favor with the King and nobles, Lully was a thorough musician.
When he went into music he found that few of the
singers could read notes, but they learned their parts by
ear. He soon changed this, and by the time he died, all
singers and players of orchestral instruments could read
well. In this reform, he did a great service to the growth
of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>His first stage works were called comedy-ballets. One
of his early works was ballet music written for a performance
of Cavalli’s opera, <cite>Xerxes</cite>, which was performed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Mazarin’s invitation at Versailles (1660). He next was
given the position of “Superintendent of Music,” became a
naturalized French citizen, and was married. Lully wrote
19 ballets, 12 comedy-ballets, and 18 operas, besides about
23 motets for special occasions. His ballets included recitatives,
airs, dialogues and symphonies, which was the name
given to music written for orchestra. From 1672 until
the time of his death in 1687, he wrote an opera a year, and
sometimes two!</p>

<p class='c008'>The splendor and extravagance of the costuming and
stage settings of these ballets and operas of Lully are almost
unbelievable! At times, even the orchestra wore costumes
of the period represented on the stage. Lully conducted
the orchestra for one opera in a magnificent Egyptian dress.
Louis XIV loved these elaborate performances, and took
part in some of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the downfall of Perrin and Cambert, which many
said was caused by Lully, he became absolute ruler in all
musical matters. He used his power to close a rival opera
house, and no opera could be given anywhere in France
without his permission, for which he received a sum of
money. He was such a tyrant that he had many enemies,
some of whom tried to poison his snuff, in order to get rid of
the King’s favorite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le Roi Soleil” (The Sun King), as Louis XIV was called,
had to be entertained, and Lully understood so well how to
keep him amused, that the King could not get along without
his composer whose performances dazzled all beholders!</p>

<p class='c008'>You must read French history of that period in order to
understand just how gorgeous and how extravagant life at
the palace of Versailles was and how eventually it led to the
revolt of the people and the French Revolution. Or perhaps
you have seen the elaborate gardens, fountains and
palace,—a playground built at fearful cost where the Kings
of France might forget their cares! The King went so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>as to give Lully a post of royal secretary, usually held by
nobles. It is said that his only claim to the position was
that he made people laugh!</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1681, his ballet <cite><span lang="fr">Triomphe de l’Amour</span></cite> (Triumph of
Love) was given, in which, for the first time, women instead
of men danced. Indeed, ladies of the nobility took part
in the ballet!</p>

<p class='c008'>The French Overture introduced by Lully, was in two
parts or movements,—the first slow and serious, the second
by way of contrast fast, and bringing in the contrapuntal style
of the church composers; sometimes a third part resembling
the first was added. These overtures were very
much liked in Lully’s time and during the 18th century, and
was the form used by the German composers in their orchestral
suites and by Handel. Lully was very successful
in composing military music, and his military marches were
used not only by the French army, but by the armies
marching <em>against</em> France. All of his music is simple and
clear in outline, it is easy to remember, its rhythm is vigorous
and definite, and the people, as well as musicians of his
day, loved and understood it. One writer said that one of his
songs from <cite>Amadis</cite>, an opera (1684), “was sung by every
cook in France and Lully would stop his carriage on the
Pont Neuf (the New Bridge across the Seine) to set some
poor fiddler right who was playing one of his airs.” His
works reached Italy, Germany, England, Holland and
Flanders, and influenced many of the composers like Purcell,
Humphrey and Handel to say nothing of the French
composers who followed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lully built up the orchestra, and used the different
groups of instruments in entirely new ways.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lully died in 1687 as the result of having dropped the
stick with which he directed his orchestra on his foot. This
does not sound possible, but the baton used in his time was
very large and heavy, and the accident caused blood poisoning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>He was very much missed, for there was no one with
his talent for conducting and disciplining the singers and
dancers to replace him.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Rameau</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In 1683, was born another French composer who carried
on the work that Lully had begun, a work so much loved by
the French public, that Jean Philippe Rameau found as
strong a rival in the dead Lully as his contemporaries had
in the living. Rameau’s father was organist of a church at
Dijon, and although the family was very poor, the father
was determined to give his three children a musical education,
and began to teach them before they could read. As
a result of this early training little Jean Philippe, when he
was only seven years old, could play at sight on the harpsichord
any music put before him, and when he was sent to
school, he was very unruly and sang out loud in class or
scribbled music all over his papers instead of doing his
lessons.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he was eighteen, he went to Italy, but as he did
not like the music, he left. He was always headstrong
and self-willed, and this was one of the hasty decisions for
which he was afterwards sorry. He traveled from place to
place on this journey, playing his way as he went, on the
organ in churches and the violin in a band of traveling musicians.
In the south of France, old Provence, the home of
the troubadours, he became organist at Clermont, and lived
quietly for six years. Here he wrote his first pieces for
clavecin (spinet) and three cantatas. (The cantata was a
new form which came from Italy, and was a small opera to
be sung in a drawing-room.) When Rameau grew tired of
his work as organist at Clermont, he showed his discontent
by playing as badly as he possibly could, by using untuneful
organ-stops and by playing fearful discords. An attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>was made to shut him off but he paid no attention until a
choir boy was sent to him with a message, whereupon he
left the organ and walked out of the church. He finally
succeeded in making the directors give him his release, but
before many years he returned to his old post, and was taken
back in spite of his disagreeable temper, and so proud was
Clermont of its organist, that his chair is still kept and
exhibited.</p>

<p class='c008'>From Clermont he went to Paris where he studied with
the organist Marchand, and read the old books of musical
theory such as Zarlino’s, for Rameau during his career
wrote five important books on musical theory and harmony.
He was the first to establish definitely the classic principles
of harmony, and to put them into a form that for many
years was used by all students. You must remember that
up to the 17th century, counterpoint was the chief study,
but when Italian opera succeeded in breaking down the
polyphonic habit, a new science had to be made to explain
the new system of <em>chords</em> that had been gradually built up
by the Italians and also by Luther and his chorals. This
was the <em>science of harmony</em>, and Rameau’s <cite>Treatise of Music,
containing the Principles of Composition</cite> (1722), was one of
the first books of its kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Until Rameau was fifty, he was known as an organist,
a teacher of composition and a writer of many charming
works for harpsichord and clavecin. He married a young
singer when he was 43, and the year after, he made the acquaintance
of a wealthy patron of the arts, at whose house
he met artists, literary men, princes and embassadors.
Rameau taught his patron’s wife, and had the use of his
organ and private orchestra. Here he first found himself
among friends who understood and appreciated his talents;
here he met the great French writer, Voltaire, and the Abbé
Pellegrin, both of whom wrote librettos for his operas.
There is a tale that the Abbé made the composer sign an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>agreement about payment for the use of his book but after
hearing the first rehearsal he tore it up—so pleased was he
with Rameau’s first opera, <cite><span lang="fr">Hippolyte et Aricie</span></cite> (1733).
Now Rameau met the jealousy of Lully’s followers, who
tried to prevent the success of the work. They hissed it
and wrote slighting verse about it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>If difficulties beauty show,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then what a great man is Rameau.</div>
      <div class='line'>If beauty, though, by chance should be</div>
      <div class='line'>But nature’s own simplicity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then what a small man is Rameau!—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>(Frederick H. Martens’ translation of <cite>A History of Music</cite>
by Paul Landormy.)</p>

<p class='c008'>It is curious how often a new style in music has been
greeted with just such criticism and prejudice as the
“Lullyists” showed for Rameau’s opera! They claimed
that the work was not French, that he used strange chords,
that his music was too difficult to be understood! In fact
they said exactly the same things that are said today
about new works which are different from what the public
is used to hearing. Voltaire said that it takes a whole
generation for the human ear to grow familiar with a new
musical style!</p>

<p class='c008'>His third opera, <cite>Castor and Pollux</cite>, in 1737, was his first
real success. With this work, he became famous, and was
regarded as France’s greatest composer. An English
noble in Paris at the time stated “that although everyone
was abusing Rameau’s ‘horrible’ work, yet it was impossible
to get a seat at the opera.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Although Rameau brought nothing new to opera, he
was the step between the Lully traditions and the innovators
who came with Gluck. The French composers today
turn to him in their search for the direct road along which
French music has traveled.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>In spite of Rameau’s unfriendly reserved nature, he won
fame by force of his genius. He was as unlike Lully as two
men could possibly have been. Rameau accepted favors
from no one, and was generous in his attitude towards his
fellow composers. He talked very little and was not popular.
However, he was at the height of his career, when a
company of Italian singers arrived in Paris (1752), and
played <cite><span lang="it">La Serva Padrona</span></cite> by Pergolesi. The fresh sparkling
little opera took Paris by storm, and this was the beginning
of a sharp fight known as the war of the buffoons (page <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>),
which divided Paris into two factions,—those who stood by
Lully and Rameau, and those who wanted to see French
opera replaced by the new Italian comic opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The charm of these light operas,” says Mary Hargrave
in her little book, <cite>The Earlier French Musicians</cite>, “lay in
the simplicity of their subjects, taken from scenes and persons
in ordinary life, humorously treated. They came
as a delightful relief after the stilted classical heroes and
heroines, the threadbare episodes of gods and goddesses,
the Greek and Roman warriors in tunics, with ribbons and
helmets on powdered wigs, in short, all the artificial conventions
of which people had at last grown unutterably
weary.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the court was divided: Louis XV was on the side of
French music, but the Queen was for the Italian, and crowds
gathered nightly at the opera near the royal boxes, which
were known as the “King’s corner,” and the “Queen’s
corner.” Word bombshells were thrown from one camp into
the other, and sometimes these became real insults! Poor
Rameau! First he was the butt of the Lullyists because
he was too modern, and now storms of abuse were heaped
on his head because he was too old-fashioned! Nevertheless,
to the end of his life his operas were received with
great enthusiasm, and on one occasion when the old man of
eighty was seen hiding in the corner of a box during one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>his operas, he was called out with storms of applause. He
was always very shy about appearing in public, applause
embarrassed him, and no doubt much of his disagreeableness
was due to his being bashful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rameau looked upon his scientific studies as more important
than his composing, and Bach, Handel and many
other composers studied his theory work even when they
were not great admirers of his compositions. We never
hear his operas, but his lovely pieces for the harpsichord,
many of which are out of his operas, are played in piano
recitals and are unsurpassed as examples of the French dance
suite. Following the fashion of his time, he gave his pieces
amusing titles such as <cite>The Call of the Birds</cite>, <cite>The Hen</cite>, <cite>The
Whirlwinds</cite>, <cite>The Egyptian</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A list of his works show that he wrote 26 operas, 2 cantatas,
5 books on theory, and 4 volumes of harpsichord
music.</p>

<p class='c008'>His death occurred in 1764, and all France mourned their
“greatest composer” and for years held memorial services
in his honor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Piron, a French writer, said of him: “All his mind and all
his soul were in his harpsichord and when he had closed
that, the house was empty, there was no one at home.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>French Composers for Clavecin and Harpsichord</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In every collection of French instrumental music of the
17th and 18th centuries, besides the names of Lully and
Rameau, we find Jacques Champion de Chambonnières
(1600–1670), Jean Baptiste Loeilly, or Loeillet (?–1728?),
François Couperin (1668–1733), Jean François Dandrieu
(1684–1740), Jean Louis Marchand (1669–1733), Louis
Claude Daquin (1694–1772) and Schobert (1720–1768).</p>

<p class='c008'>These writers for clavecin and harpsichord of the French
school were the first to write music for instruments to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>they gave names describing the nature of the compositions.
So, now, in addition to the names of dances which formed
the suites, we find <cite>The Coucou</cite>, <cite>Butterflies</cite>, <cite>Tambourine</cite>,
<cite>The Windmill</cite>, <cite>The Turtle-Doves</cite>, and so on. This was an
important step for it led directly to the kind of titles given
to piano pieces in the 19th century by the German romantic
school.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most important of this group was François Couperin,
called “the great,” as he was the most gifted member of
a family, who supplied France with musicians for two
centuries. From 1665 to 1826, there were eight Couperins
who were organists of St. Gervais’ Church in Paris.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can compare the Couperin family to the Bachs who
flourished at the same time in Germany. François (1668–1733),
was only a year old when his father died, but a friend,
who was an organist, taught him and in time he, too, became
organist at St. Gervais. He was harpsichord player
to the King, and was a favorite in court circles. No
fashionable affair was complete without Couperin at the
harpsichord, and every Sunday evening he played chamber
music for Louis XIV, the royal patron of Lully. One of
the books of pieces for the clavecin was published under the
title of <cite>Royal Concerts</cite>, and in the preface, Couperin told
that they were written for “<i><span lang="fr">les petits concerts du roi</span></i>” (the
little concerts of the king), and he also said that he hoped
the public would like the pieces as much as the King did.
For twenty years Couperin played in the King’s household,
and taught several princes and princesses.</p>

<p class='c008'>You know the old proverb, “All roads lead to Rome.”
We would change it, and say that all roads lead to Bach!
And Couperin is one of the main highways, for without
knowing that he was doing so, he prepared the way for
Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Everything he
wrote, and most of his pieces were in the dance form of the
suite, was exquisite in refinement and taste. The French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>musicians of today look upon him as one of their composers,
most truly French, and they try to follow in the way
he led, so as to be able to write music that will express the
French people, in heart and character. Later in the story
of music, the German classic school and then the romantic
school had a very strong influence on the music of every
country in the world, and in France there was the desire to
brush aside the outside influences, and to find the road that
the early French composers of the 17th and 18th centuries
had traveled. Paul Landormy, a French writer on musical
history has summed up Couperin as “one of the miracles of
the French spirit in music, and across the gulf of time he
clasps hands on one side with Jannequin and Costeley
(p. <a href='#Page_437'>437</a>), on the other with Fauré and Debussy” (p. <a href='#Page_416'>416</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'>All the important music outside of opera written in France
at this time was for the clavecin and harpsichord, and if the
flute or the viol was invited to take part in a concert, it was
only to double the melody played by the harpsichord, and
did not have a part especially created for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wouldn’t you be surprised today if you should see an
announcement of a concert to be given by the President’s
chauffeurs? But in the time of Couperin and Lully wind
instruments were used in all the court festivals, balls and
ballets, and were played by men attached to the great
hunting stables of the king. The band was called <i><span lang="fr">la
musique de la grande écurie du Roi</span></i> (music of the King’s
stables). There were twelve trumpets, eight fifes and
drums, the cromornes (krumhorn—a curved reed instrument),
four to six Poitou oboes and bagpipes, and twelve
large oboes under which title were included violins, oboes,
sackbuts and cornets. These players of wind instruments
accompanied the royal hunting parties and made the
beautiful forests of France ring with their merry music.
Each family had its own hunting call, by which it was
recognized from afar. We heard a phonograph record in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Paris of these ancient calls, and with each one, the name
of the family to whom it belonged was announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the way, do you know the difference between a band
and an orchestra? (This is not a conundrum!) A band
was originally a group of musicians who played while
standing or marching, while the orchestra was always
seated. This word comes from the Greek word meaning
dance, and was first given to a group of players who accompanied
the dancers in the dramas, and were seated in that
section of the theatre which is still called the orchestra.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVII<br> <span class='c016'>Germany Enters—Organs, Organists and Organ Works</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>It is rather hard to believe that the largest of all instruments,
the pipe organ, is a descendant of Pan’s Pipes,
played by the shepherds on the hillsides of ancient Greece,
is it not? The pipes of the church organ of today are of
different lengths and are built on the same principle as
were the pipes of Pan, our goat-footed friend, who broke
off the reeds by the bank of a stream way back when the
world was young, to pour out his grief in music for his
lost love, Syrinx.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next step was to supply the organ pipes with wind
so they could be made to produce tones without blowing
on each one separately. A wooden box was invented, and
each pipe inserted into a hole in the top of the box, which
is still called the wind-chest. At first this was supplied
with air by two attendants who blew into tubes attached
to the wind-chest. Soon the tubes were replaced by bellows,
and were worked with the arms, and as the instrument
grew larger, with the feet like in a treadmill. An organ
is spoken of in the Talmud as having stood in the Temple
of Jerusalem, and the hydraulic (water) organ in which
air was supplied to the pipes by means of water power
was built in Alexandria, Egypt, about the year 250 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
The small organ with keys that could be carried from
place to place was called a portative (from the Latin <em>porto</em>—to
carry); the larger organ sometimes stationary and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>sometimes moved on wheels was called a positive. The
levers needed to produce the sound were soon exchanged
for keyboards which at first had only a few keys, and you
may remember our telling how the keys were pounded
with the fists and elbows, in the Winchester organ.</p>

<p class='c008'>A Greek writer of the 4th century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> gives us a vivid
description of an organ: “I see a strange sort of reeds—they
must methinks have sprung from no earthly, but a
brazen soil. Wild are they, nor does the breath of man stir
them, but a blast, leaping forth from a cavern of oxhide,
passes within, beneath the roots of the polished reeds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not known just when the organ was first used in
the churches, but there are records of its having been
known in Spanish churches as early as the 5th century
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> Pope Vitalian introduced it in Rome in 666, and in
the 8th century in England, organ-building became a very
popular profession. Cecil Forsyth says: “In those days
a monk or bishop who wished to stand well with society
could not take up essay-writing or social-welfare: what
he could do was to lay hands on all the available timber,
metal, and leather, and start organ-building.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Pepin, the father of Charlemagne, imported an organ
into Compiègne, France, from Byzantium in the 8th century.
Charlemagne had it copied at Aix-la-Chapelle.
The Arabians must have been organ-builders, too, for one
of their most famous rulers, Haroun-al-Raschid, sent Charlemagne
a pneumatic organ noted for its soft tone. The
instruments made in Germany and France up to the 10th
century were small and unpretending, but were objects
of astonishment and curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Magdeburg, in the 11th century, we find the first
keyboard with keys 3 inches broad. In 1120, we hear of
an organ in the Netherlands that had 2 manuals (keyboards)
and pedals. Organ-building was growing up! In
the 14th century the manuals of many organs had 31 keys.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>The organ was not always accepted in the church, for
in the 13th century its use was regarded as scandalous
just as the English Puritans in the 17th century called it a
“squeaking abomination,” and it is not even now admitted
in the Greek Catholic Church!</p>

<p class='c008'>Until the 14th century, the organ had been used only
in a most primitive way to guide the singers of plain-song.
It became a solo instrument when it was possible to grade
its tone from soft to loud, which was done by the invention
and use of three manuals: the upper one played “<em>full
organ</em>” (very loud); the middle, the <i><span lang="la">discant</span></i> (softest),
played a counterpoint to the subject; the subject was
played on the lowest keyboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>So we see how one invention led to another until the
organ became an instrument of almost unlimited possibilities,
and how keyed instruments had shown the composers
how to develop music along new lines. By the end
of the 16th century, organ compositions and organ-playing
had made rapid progress all over Europe, and you will
recall the great organists in all the churches and cathedrals
in the Netherlands, in England, Italy, France, Spain, and
even in Germany which up to this time had not been on
the “musical map.” (Chapter XI).</p>

<p class='c008'>Are you wondering why we have gone back into “ancient
history” at this point, or have you already discovered
that these grand old organists are leading us directly
Bach-ward?</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Frescobaldi</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Just a century before Bach’s time, the greatest of all
Italian organists, Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583–1644), was
born at Ferrara, Italy. So popular was he, that he filled
the vast Cathedral of St. Peter’s, whenever he played.
His compositions were the most important produced for
organ in the early 17th century, and his fugues were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>first to be treated in modern fashion, in form, fancy, and
feeling for tone color, and were a foundation on which
Bach’s were built. His compositions include <i><span lang="it">canzones</span></i>,
<em>toccatas</em>, <i><span lang="it">ricercari</span></i>, and numerous pieces in the popular
dance forms. Most of these are found in two collections
published for <i><span lang="it">cembalo e organo</span></i> (spinet and organ). He
was not interested in opera, but went his own musical way
expressing himself in an original and individual language
far ahead of his period. With Frescobaldi, Italy ceased to
be the world’s center for organists.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>German Organists</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>At this point, Germany came into the musical field,
and soon became the artistic center of organ-playing. Up
to this time, the country had produced less music than
any of its neighbors: Italy had written the greatest Church
music, and invented opera; France had followed closely
in Italy’s footsteps; the Low Countries had helped in
music’s growth by their early work in polyphony and had
taught all Europe including Germany; England had led
the world in her compositions for virginals and harpsichord,
the forerunners of piano music. Although Germany
did not at first rank musically with these countries, the
religious fervor and devotion to the cause of Protestantism
bore fruit in the grand chorales of Luther. In these we
find the birth of German music destined to rule the world
for two centuries, the 18th and the 19th, just as the Italian
had in the 16th and the 17th. The religious inspiration,
the direct simplicity and sincerity of the chorales are
the qualities found in the works of the first great German
composer, Johann Sebastian Bach!</p>

<p class='c008'>The religious wars of the first half of the 17th century
crushed almost all the music out of Germany. In the second
half, the organists became the leaders, and their music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>for organ inspired by the chorale was the first real contribution
that Germany made to the growth of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the earliest of these German organists was Johann
Jacob Froberger (1605–1667), of Saxony, who was a pupil
of Frescobaldi, and court organist at Vienna. He went to
London (1662), and as he was robbed on the way, he arrived
penniless. He found work as organ-blower at Westminster
Abbey. On the occasion of Charles II’s marriage,
he overblew the bellows and interrupted the playing, which
so enraged the organist Christopher Gibbons, son of
Orlando, that he struck him. Poor Froberger! But he
had a chance to redeem himself, for he sat down to the
organ a few moments later, and started to improvise in a
manner for which he was famous in Vienna. A former
pupil of his, recognizing his style, was overjoyed to find
him, and presented him to the King. He was invited to
play on the harpsichord which he did to the astonishment
of every one.</p>

<p class='c008'>A Dutch organist, Johann Adam Reinken (1623–1722)
and a Dane, Dietrich Buxtehude (1637–1707) belong to this
school, as they lived in Germany most of their lives and
worked along the lines the Germans were developing.
Reinken was a pupil of Frescobaldi; he had a direct influence
on Bach who often walked from Lüneburg to Hamburg
to hear the far-famed organist. When Reinken was
99 years old he heard Bach improvise on his Chorale “By
the Waters of Babylon,” which drew from him the praise,
“I thought that this art was dead, but I see that it still
lives in you.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Absolute Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is very probable that had Buxtehude not lived, Bach
would have written his organ works in a different style,
so deeply did the younger composer study the older man’s
compositions. Buxtehude was organist in Lüneburg and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>there he started a series of concerts which became so popular
that they were continued into the 19th century. Bach
walked fifty miles to hear Buxtehude play, but was too
shy to make himself known to the great man; it was probably
to hear one of the concerts which had the poetic name
of <cite><span lang="de">Abendmusik</span></cite> (Evening Music), that he went. Buxtehude
was one of the first to try to make instrumental music
stand as music (a language in itself), without a dance form,
a plain-song or chorale or poetic idea behind it, to
act as a Biblical text does in a sermon. This music for
music’s sake is called “Absolute Music” and Bach was
one of its strongest disciples. Absolute music, which was
so beautifully handled by Buxtehude, became the basis of
the Classic School of the 18th and early 19th centuries.</p>

<p class='c008'>The organ chorale prelude which was so important a musical
form during this period had a very interesting history.
Today the organist in our churches plays the hymn through
before it is sung; he plays it quite simply just as it is written
in the Hymnal, but in the day of these old German
organists, the artistic feeling was deeper, and the organist
was allowed to weave the chorale or hymn into a beautiful
and complete composition. But in his love of composing
and of showing how many different ways he could
decorate the chorale, he often exceeded his time limit, and
the chorale prelude was left behind. In its place the organ
fantasia and the sonata appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Johann Pachelbel (1653–1706), of Nüremberg, was a
pupil of another celebrated director and organist, Johann
Kaspar Kerl (1628–1693), who was said to be one of the
best teachers of composition of his day. There were also
three German organists born late in the 16th century,
all of whom were followers of the famous Dutch composer
Jan Sweelinck. They were known as the “three
S’s”—Heinrich Schütz was the greatest of them. He
wrote organ music, but also worked out a scheme for combining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the chorale with the ideas of Peri and Caccini for
use with Bible texts in the Lutheran Church. This was
called Passion music and was originally written for Good
Friday. On this foundation Bach built some of his grandest
oratorios. The Italian influence came into Schütz’s
work while he was a pupil of Gabrieli in Venice. Johann
Heinrich Schein was a Cantor at St. Thomas’ School before
Bach, and wrote many chorales. The third of the “three
S’s” was Samuel Scheidt who was called the German
Frescobaldi. “What plain-song was to Palestrina and his
school, the chorale was to Schütz and his followers.”
(Quoted from Charles Villiers Stanford.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Inventor of the Sonata and of “Program Music”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Johann Kuhnau (1660–1722), wrote many compositions
which today we find very amusing! For his day, however,
he must have been looked upon as ultra-modern! The composition
which first brought him into public notice was a
motet, written for the election of the town council. Could
you imagine anyone writing a serious composition for an
election today, or anyone willing to listen to it at the polls?
He was organist of St. Thomas’, in Leipsic, a graduated
lawyer, master of several languages, writer of satirical
poems, musical director of the University, and finally
Cantor in two Churches. He was admired and honored
after his death as one of the greatest musicians of his day
and one of the most learned men. He invented a style of
music for the clavier which he called Sonata. It was in
several movements and was not based on dance tunes as
were the suites. While it was not in the form that later
was known as sonata-form, it was a sign-post pointing the
way. Seven of these sonatas he named <cite>Fresh Clavier
Fruit</cite>! And it was fresh in style as well as in name.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>He was the first German composer to write “program
music,” that is the kind which tries to tell a story, or to
imitate the actual sounds of natural objects, such as the
crash of thunder, the motion of a windmill, the rocking of
a cradle, and the cackling of a hen. You can see how long
a list one might make and how easy it would be for anyone
with a vivid imagination to make up all sorts of pictures
in music. This is just the opposite from music for
music’s sake which we described to you as “Absolute
Music,” and most of it which follows this period when
music comes of age can be put into one of the two camps,—the
Program Music Camp, or the Absolute Music
Camp.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kuhnau’s program music took a queer turn! He was
living at a time when religion was uppermost in every one’s
thoughts, when the Bible stories were bedtime stories and
when the leading compositions were the sonatas written
for organ. So in 1700 he published six Biblical-history
Sonatas. In <cite>David and Goliath</cite>, he attempts to put into
music the rude defiance and bravado of the giant; the
fear of the Hebrews; David’s courage and fearlessness,
and the battle and fall of the giant; the flight of the Philistines
(can’t you imagine how the composer would represent
this with all kinds of runs and scales?); the joy of
the Hebrews; the celebration of the women who probably
came out to meet David “with timbrels and harps”; and
general jubilation.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the end of the 17th century, Germany was strongly
under the influence of France and Italy, especially in opera.
In Dresden, Berlin, Munich and Vienna, one heard only
opera in Italian sung by Italian singers, but Hamburg
tried to develop a national music by giving German opera
sung by German singers, and attracted many serious musicians.
Johann Mattheson (1681–1764) a singer, conductor
and composer, is remembered chiefly for a book called <cite>A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>German Roll of Honor</cite>, in which he gathered up all the information
he could find about German composers up to his
time. He asked all the living composers to write accounts
of themselves for his book, so we take it for granted that
it must be truthful!</p>

<p class='c008'>Music had changed more in the 17th century than in
any that had gone before. If we tried to sum it all up in
one word we should say that it was a century of <em>transition</em>
or the passage from one condition to another. It began
with the old Ecclesiastical, or Church, modes, and ended
with the major and minor scales which we still use today;
the reign of counterpoint was over, and now had to share
the throne on equal terms with harmony.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sonata-Form</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The dominating musical form after Bach’s time was to
be the Sonata, a name we have often used. The sonata
which found its champions in Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven,
was the child of the sonata written by D. Scarlatti,
Kuhnau, and Bach and his sons. It is built on the principle
of contrast as were the suites. A sonata is a collection
of three or four related pieces called movements: one,
fast—one, slow—then fast. If in four movements, the
first is moderately fast; the second, very slow; the third,
fast (scherzo); the fourth fast (usually rondo form).</p>

<p class='c008'>Sonata-form is the name given to the first movement
of a sonata, a string quartet, trio, quintet, etc., concerto
or a symphony. It has two main themes which are announced,
then developed and then re-announced, forming
three contrasting sections or panels: <cite>Statement</cite> or <cite>Exposition</cite>,
<cite>Development</cite>, and <cite>Restatement</cite>. From now on, when
we speak of <em>sonata-form</em>, this picture should come to you.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stage is now all set for Bach and those who came
after him.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>Music Has Grown Up</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVIII<br> <span class='c016'>Bach—The Giant</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Bach and Handel rescued the Germans from the reputation
of being musical barbarians, for Germany had
not had a Lully or a Palestrina! But just in time, Bach and
Handel entered and Bach carried composition to maturity
and religious musical art to its highest point, while Handel
was one of the foremost opera and oratorio composers of
his day.</p>

<p class='c008'>And indeed not until Mozart’s day did the Italians
think that Germany was anything but barbarous, not in
fact until they were outranked in Italian Opera by a
German.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of all the unassuming men of genius Johann Sebastian
Bach (1685–1750) is the most lovable. Never did he seem
to realize that he was doing anything, but the will of God,
never did he seem to care what people thought of his work,
but went on composing, supporting twenty children, often
with so little money that he tutored and played at funerals
to eke out a living. In his life there was little glitter.
Bach was a saint, if there was ever a saint. Although
some few admired Bach during his lifetime, it was not
until one hundred years after his death that his works
were known and that he received the fame he deserved.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bach family for six generations were musicians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>beginning with his grandfather “to the 5th power,” Veit
Bach, a Thuringian baker in the 16th century whose
pleasure “was to use a small zither, which he took with
him to play, while the mill was moving.” All his descendants
became musicians down to and beyond Johann
Sebastian.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bachs were great family lovers and every year
they held reunions, at which all of the different members
living in various parts of Germany, met together and enjoyed
a jolly time singing and playing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sebastian was born in 1685 in Eisenach, the town where
Martin Luther wrote his stirring chorales. His father
Ambrosius began very early to teach him music, the family
profession, and Sebastian started with the violin.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the poor little boy lost both father and mother
when only ten years of age, and he was left to be brought
up by his elder brother, Johann Christopher. Sebastian
was passionately fond of music and although Christopher
taught him to play the clavier, nevertheless this
sad little tale is told:</p>

<p class='c008'>Sebastian had seen Christopher with a book of music
including pieces by Froberger, Pachelbel, Buxtehude,
and others. Sebastian was very anxious to get it and play
bits from it. Christopher forbade him to touch it and
put it away in a cupboard, which fortunately had a lattice
door, for Sebastian, every night during the full moon, (because
he did not dare to use a candle), copied the book
note for note. When Christopher discovered this, the
little lad was soundly scolded and was witness to Christopher’s
burning it before his poor eyes!</p>

<p class='c008'>It did not seem to daunt him, for from this time on, he
copied the great works whenever he could.</p>

<p class='c008'>It became necessary for Sebastian to earn money to save
Christopher’s purse, and in 1700 he became a choir boy at
St. Michael’s in Lüneburg, where he received lessons without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>paying for them. He was happy here, with a library
where he could copy music to his heart’s content, and every
vacation he went on foot to Hamburg to learn of the great
organist, Reinken. He visited too the court of Celle where
he heard Couperin’s music, which no doubt helped to develop
his style.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon he left Lüneburg and went to Saxe-Weimar where
he entered the orchestra of Prince Johann Ernst. But his
interest was in the church and when he was eighteen he
tried for the post of organist in the Church at Arnstadt.
He played so delightfully, despite his youth, that he was
accepted at the first hearing!</p>

<p class='c008'>He composed many works here and learned much about
the organ, that was to be valuable to him and to us. He
was well liked, too, and his playing was enjoyed. Nevertheless,
his interest in others was so great, that he decided
to go to see Buxtehude in Lübeck, and he was so interested
in the master’s art that he forgot about his church in
Arnstadt and stayed four months instead of one! When
he returned he was severely reprimanded. Later, he received
a second reprimand which is of tremendous interest
for he was accused of “interspersing the chorale with
many strange variations and tones, to the confusion of the
congregation.” He was charged with the crime of being
original!</p>

<p class='c008'>Due to this lack of sympathy, he accepted a post as organist
at Mühlhausen in 1707 and later in the year married his
cousin, Maria Barbara, with great rejoicings. They had
seven children, two of whom were the famous Wilhelm
Friedemann and Karl Philip Emanuel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next year he became Concertmaster (first violinist),
to the Duke of Weimar and remained there until 1718.
This was a very fruitful composing period, for he had no
money worries. He studied the Italian masters, especially
Vivaldi, and wrote some excellent cantatas. However, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>went soon to the Prince of Anhalt-Cothen, as Court Choir
Master.</p>

<p class='c008'>He made concert trips from here to Dresden and Leipsic,
and it was in Dresden that he challenged the proud Marchand,
the French organist, to a public improvisation contest
on a theme, new to both of them. But the contest
never took place, because, unknown to Bach, Marchand
heard him play and when the time for the contest came,
Marchand had left town hurriedly in an early post-chaise.
And strange as it may seem, Emperor Frederick I gave
Marchand one hundred ducats and Bach got nothing!</p>

<p class='c008'>Bach’s new patron was a fine man and a Protestant and
gave Bach every chance. At Weimar, he had become well
known for his religious works and beautiful playing. But,
as he had no organ, he wrote music for harpsichord, violin,
chamber music and the orchestra, which was far from
“grown up.” Here, too, he wrote the Brandenburg Concertos
and the first part of his epoch-making work <cite>The
Well-tempered Clavichord</cite> (48 Preludes and Fugues, 1722)
which he finished in 1744. It is still the greatest work of its
kind. In it he reaches the highest point of contrapuntal
writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1720, while Bach was traveling with the Prince, his
wife died. After a year and a half he married a charming
singer, Anna Magdalena Wulkens, one of his pupils. They
had twelve children and lived very happily. The lovely
little tunes that he wrote for Anna Magdalena and his children
have come down to us and many of us have played
them in the first years of our music study. Isn’t it wonderful
to think that the great Bach, who wrote some of the
masterpieces of the world, could also write simple little
Minuets and Preludes that any child can play?</p>

<p class='c008'>But with all Bach’s comfort he missed an organ! Deep in
his soul, he craved the making of religious music—it was
part of his thinking. His religious ideas tied up with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>music, were his life. So we see this saint leaving happiness
at Cothen for an ill-paid post in Leipsic, as Cantor
(1723) at the school of St. Thomas, where, succeeding
Johann Kuhnau, he stayed the rest of his life and wrote his
greatest works.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bach wrote to a friend that he thought a long while
before leaving his “gracious, music loving and discriminating
Prince&#160;... but it happened that my master
married a&#160;... princess who&#160;... weaned my master
from the loving interest he had&#160;... toward our
glorious art. And so God arranged that the post of Cantor
at St. Thomas’ should fall vacant.... I took three
months to consider the future and was induced to accept,
as my sons were studious and I was desirous&#160;... of gratifying
their bent by entering them in the school&#160;... and
thus, in the name of the Most High, I ventured and came
to Leipsic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Note, dear reader, the nobility, spirituality and sweetness
here, thinking of his children and not of his career!</p>

<p class='c008'>He struggled against the unsympathetic town council,
the school, and lack of money. He wrote to his friend
Erdman, “My present income averages $700. When funerals
are numerous I make more, but if the ‘air is healthy’
then my income falls. During the past year I have earned
$100 less, owing to the small number of deaths.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1732 he wrote one of his few attempts at comedy.—the
<cite>Coffee Cantata</cite> set to music on a text by Picander.
Leipsic had become a slave to the new luxury, coffee, and
in this Picander found material for a satire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides his regular work, he had to teach dull, undisciplined
pupils, attend to services in four churches, and be
satisfied with the few singers and players he found for the
performances he directed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet, fed with the spirit of love that was within him, he
was happy and his home was a center of joy. He never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>became too sad until he lost his sight three years before his
death. Even then he dictated his compositions and conquered
discouragement!</p>

<p class='c008'>Bach’s life was made happier when Philip Emanuel
became Court musician and clavier player to Frederick the
Great, and he talked so much of his father that Bach was
invited to Potsdam.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Frederick the Great, who was playing the flute
in his orchestra, heard that Bach was in Potsdam, he put
down his flute and interrupted the concert saying, “Gentlemen,
old Bach has arrived.” Bach appeared in his traveling
clothes and was invited to improvise a fugue in six
parts, which he did to the great admiration of all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet many felt that his writings were lacking in charm!
This was no doubt because people were getting accustomed
to the Italian melodies which had become popular
in Germany. Furthermore, when he wrote “The Art of
Fugue” his son could sell but thirty copies and finally
sold the plates for the mere cost of the metal! Students
are grateful that copies of this work were saved, for it is
still the greatest authority on fugue writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1749, Bach underwent an operation on his eyes but lost
his sight and in 1750 died of apoplexy. So little was he
appreciated that his grave was destroyed in the renovation
of the Johanneskirche grounds. His supposed remains
were discovered in 1894 and re-interred one hundred and
forty-four years after his death. But—what remains of
Bach, no known or unknown grave can bury.</p>

<p class='c008'>A quarter of a century after Bach’s death, Mozart said,
on hearing a Bach Cantata, “At last I have heard something
new and have learned something.” Then later
Mendelssohn re-discovered him, and Schubert, too, helped
to bring him to the world’s notice. And not until 1850,
a century after his death, was the Bach Society formed
to honor Bach, the corner-stone of modern music.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Bach was a stalwart man with fine deep eyes, broad forehead
and a grave face, lit with kindly humor. He had dignity
and calm, was always courteous, and criticised only
his pupils whom he wanted to help. When asked one time,
how he played so well, he remarked, “I always have had
to work hard.” He could stand no one who was pretentious
and conceited. He wanted his rights but never
boasted. One year besides fulfilling his other duties he
wrote a cantata every Sunday! He wrote them as a preacher
writes sermons. They had to be done and he never neglected
his duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bach was a devoted father and husband and his home
was one of the happiest of any great genius. Many of his
children were musical and he said that he had an orchestra
in his own home!</p>

<p class='c008'>Even his little half-witted son had genius and during
the last years of Bach’s life when the dear old man had
become blind, the little boy sat at the clavier, Bach’s favorite
instrument, and improvised to the joy of his father.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bach’s Works</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is impossible to describe in words just what Bach
accomplished, so surpassing in beauty are his best works.</p>

<p class='c008'>He brought the art of polyphonic writing to its highest
and most sublime point. His value to the student cannot
be exaggerated, for he is the musical Bible to all who would
be musicians.</p>

<p class='c008'>The organ was the core of his musical thinking and it is in
the things which center about the organ that his art is loftiest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although he was most ingenious in writing counterpoint,
he was never dry and tricky as were other writers. His
subjects were always original and his melodic line always
of rare beauty.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>His works are most varied: fugues, motets, cantatas,
passions, oratorios, concertos, sonatas and suites. He
was a radical in his day, for he threw over conventional
notions of harmony as to proper keys and insisted upon a
new system of tuning the clavier, so as to use the whole
range of tones. The “Well-tempered Clavichord,” two
groups of 24 Preludes and Fugues in 24 keys, was the outcome
of this. It was so called because it was written to
show the possibilities of a clavier (or clavichord) tuned
according to an idea of his, enabling one to play in all keys.
This was one of the greatest discoveries in the whole story
of music, for it made possible all the music which has
followed. The keyboard was divided into equal half-steps.
This made twelve half-steps within each octave
and thus all the intervals became fixed, and modulation
from key to key was possible. Heretofore, if one went
from one key to another, the instrument sounded out of
tune, but now instruments were tuned, as we glibly say,
“to scale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He invented a new fingering in which the thumb and
little finger were used for the first time. We wonder why
the thumb had been snubbed!</p>

<p class='c008'>The pianoforte was just coming into prominence in
Bach’s day but he preferred the clavier, on which he felt
he could play with more expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>He developed the fugue to its highest point. A fugue
is an enlarged canon in which the fragments of theme or
melody are taken up and answered by two, or more, voices.
One voice declares the subject and the answer is repeated
usually in the dominant key a fifth above, while the first
voice gives the counter-subject. There are various kinds of
fugues, depending on their construction. After the voices
have all entered, separated sometimes by little passages
called “episodes,” a section in which the subject is freely
developed comes, and then the stretto, in which all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>parts enter racing and overlapping, building up to a climax;
then follows the cadence or ending.</p>

<p class='c008'>To write a noble or lofty fugue, neither dry nor pedantic,
takes art to the <em>nth</em> power! Bach had the art that touched
Heaven’s borders! In truth you can safely divide fugues
into two classes—Bach’s and all others!</p>

<p class='c008'>None of Bach’s works were published until he was forty
years old, and most of them not until long after his death,
and many of his manuscripts were lost and never published
at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>The list of his works is stupendous; the Bach Gesellschaft
(Bach Society, 1850) published them in sixty volumes!
Among them were the 48 Preludes and Fugues (The Well-tempered
Clavichord Collection); 12 Suites; many Inventions
in 2 and 3 parts; partitas; 12 concertos for 1, 2, 3 and
4 claviers with orchestra; many sonatas and concertos for
violin, flute, viola da gamba, clavier, and orchestra; several
overtures for orchestras; vocal works; 200 motets
and cantatas; 5 <cite>Passions</cite>, of which the greatest are the
St. Matthew and the St. John; 5 masses of which his
<cite>B Minor Mass</cite> is a world masterpiece; oratorios; magnificats;
many organ works, and old German chorales harmonized
for voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>When you can, try to hear Wanda Landowska play Bach
compositions on the harpsichord. It is a glimpse into the
beauty of the saintly Bach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Also try to hear the great Bach Festival, directed by
Frederick Wolle held yearly in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
in the Moravian Church.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a list of great men, Bach would be classed with Euripides,
Sophocles, Shakespeare, Milton, da Vinci, Michael
Angelo and Goethe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bach did not write for people, he wrote for his own
soul. He never seemed able to write theatric music, for his
was the drama of the spirit. Always, his music was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>result of his musings, the confessions of his ideals. So he
attained a loftiness, grandeur and sublimity far removed
from even some of the most dramatic writers.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bach’s Sons</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Bach’s sons reached great eminence. The eldest was
Wilhelm Friedemann (1710–1784), an unusually talented
man on whom the father built great hopes. But while
Friedemann inherited his father’s musical talent he did not
have his character, and was looked upon as a disgrace to
the family on account of his dissolute ways. He was the
greatest organist of his time and most of his compositions,
which were considered very fine, have been lost to the
world, for he did not take the trouble even to write them
down, but played them from memory.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third son, Karl Philip Emanuel (1714–1788), although
trained to be a lawyer, could not resist the urge of
music, and after going through two universities decided
to become a musician to Frederick the Great. He was
“general manager” of all the music at court until the
Seven Years’ War put an end to his position after almost
thirty years’ service. He then spent the rest of his life
in Hamburg. As composer, conductor, teacher and critic
his influence was great. He was loved and respected by
the whole city. In his day he was regarded as being as
important as his father, but we know that he was not in
the same class, although he was the greatest of his contemporaries.
He did not imitate his father’s style but
developed the sonata into the form that Haydn, Mozart
and Beethoven perfected. He was an innovator, not only
in form, but in the treatment of melody and harmony. His
best sonatas were written at the court of Frederick the
Great.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the growth of music he is the link between his immortal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>father and Haydn. Haydn was more gifted than
he and made the seeds planted by Philip Emanuel blossom
luxuriantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Johann Christoph (1732–1795) was an upright, modest,
amiable man, and a splendid musician keeping up the family
traditions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Johann Christian (1735–1782), the youngest of those
who outlived the father, might be called the Italian Bach,
because he went to Italy in 1754, became organist of the
Milan Cathedral, and wrote vocal music in the Neapolitan
style. He left his position as organist, married an
Italian prima donna, wrote many operas and spent the
last twenty years of his life in London, as director of
concerts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Curious as it may seem, the great and gifted Bach family
died out in 1845, with a grandson of Johann Sebastian.
Out of twenty children there seems not to have been one
to carry the line to the present day.</p>

<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>George Frederick Handel—Master of Oratorio</span><br> (1685–1759)</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c029'>In the last chapter we saw Bach rescue music from the
danger of emptiness and frivolity, by perfecting polyphonic
music and dignifying church music as it had not
been since Palestrina.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bach and Handel were alike in that they were both born
in Germany when music, especially opera, had become
mechanical and full of set rules. They were both Lutherans
and Thuringians. They worked about the same time,
and tried to encourage the hearts and minds of their country,
torn by the Thirty Years’ War; both were polyphonic
masters; both organists. Bach attached himself to Frederick
the Great, the protector of the faith, and Handel went
to England, where there was liberty of thought; and both,
died blind and of apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The differences, with so many similarities, are most
interesting. Bach, modest, retiring, was always a German
subject; Handel became an English subject. Bach
was a homebody with twenty children; Handel was a
traveler and never married. Bach wanted only to satisfy
himself; Handel, to satisfy the public. Bach was humble,
Handel arrogant. Bach seldom fought for his rights,
while Handel would dismiss even his masters. Bach cared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>little for applause, but Handel could not live without it.
Bach was devoted to the lyric, Handel to the epic. Handel
is usually (not always) heroic, Bach is usually religious (not
always, of course). Handel is popular, easy to understand;
Bach is deep, coming from the soul, and it takes more
thought than the crowd is always willing to give to appreciate
this giant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Handel achieved great worldly success, and treated
nobles as equals. Poor Bach worked contentedly in an
humble position and struggled for money and profited by
“bad air.” (See page <a href='#Page_248'>248</a>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Bach demanded faith and love of art, Handel demanded
ready ears. Bach never intended to make music, he only
wanted to express his devotion in the best medium he had;
Handel wanted fame and riches and the approval of the
crowd. Handel died rich and Bach died poor.</p>

<p class='c008'>George Frederick Handel (1685–1759) who wrote the
immortal oratorio <cite>Messiah</cite>, and one of the greatest opera
composers of his time, was born in Halle, Saxony. His
father was a barber, but managed to get the title “Chamberlain
to the Prince of Saxe-Magdeburg.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Handel’s father wished him to study law, but George
Frederick did not like the idea and besides he showed
great musical gifts. One day when he was a little boy, he
found hidden in the attic, a clavichord upon which he
secretly played every chance he had.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not long after this “find,” something most important
happened. His father was going to Weissenfels to the
Duke’s castle and had no intention of taking George
Frederick with him. So, Father Handel seated himself in
the coach, taking things comfortably, when he spied little
George Frederick dashing along by the great wheels. He
paid no attention to him, but after going a mile and realizing
that the little boy was still following, he called out
“What do you want?” “I want to go with you,” answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Handel, and although his father was quite annoyed, George
Frederick’s will, as always, prevailed and he went with
his father! At the court the Duke saw, very quickly, how
gifted the little Handel was. His father relented and on
his return to Halle, George Frederick was given instruction
on the organ, harpsichord and in composition with Zachau,
and taught himself the oboe and violin, greedily mastering
all the music he could find.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although he studied music he seems to have respected
his father’s wishes and studied law and even after his father
died in 1697, he continued, but later gave it up for music.
At seventeen he entered the University, and studied,
besides music, the literary classics which were of great use
to him later.</p>

<p class='c008'>On leaving the University he went to Hamburg, the musical
center of Germany, where he heard Keiser’s works and
received good advice from Johann Mattheson, the composer,
tenor and conductor, who later engaged George
Frederick in a duel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The quarrel came about in this way: Handel was to
lead Mattheson’s opera, <cite>Cleopatra</cite>, in order to relieve Mattheson,
who sang the part of Antonio. After Antonio was
“killed,” Mattheson being free to lead, entered the orchestra
pit to take Handel’s place as leader. Handel was infuriated.
They met later and fought a duel in which Handel
was saved by a large metal button which snapped Mattheson’s
rapier! What a little thing a button is and what
it did for music!</p>

<p class='c008'>Handel’s first four operas were written here for the
Hamburg stage. But <cite>Almira</cite> (1705) is the only one ever
heard now.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Handel in Italy</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Next he visited Florence, Rome and Venice during
which time he had the happiest three years of his life. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>composed a cantata, an oratorio and other works; he
learned much of melody and sweet flowing music, which
softened his dry, stiff use of German counterpoint, and
he gathered material for his later London work.</p>

<p class='c008'>An amusing story is told of him in Venice. There was a
carnival going on and Handel went to it. At one of the
costume balls, he sat down to a harpsichord uninvited and
began improvising, thinking that no one would know him.
A gorgeously garbed figure dashed through the crowd
to his side, and almost overcome by the music, gasped, “This
is either the Devil or the Saxon.” (Handel was called
“The dear Saxon”—“<cite><span lang="it">Il cáro Sarsone</span></cite>” in Italy.) It was
Domenico Scarlatti’s first meeting with Handel, and forever
after they remained warm friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Vienna he met Steffani (Chapel Master) who persuaded
him to go to Hanover and after a short time, the
Elector, who became George I of England, appointed him
Chapel Master and gave him permission to go to England
for a visit before taking up his new work.</p>

<p class='c008'>This visit was the turning point in Handel’s career, for
later he became an English subject and he—but we must
not get ahead of our story!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Handel in England</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Handel went to England about fifteen years after the
death of Purcell, “The Orpheus of England.” Handel was
quick to see Purcell’s good points and modelled his first
English work to celebrate the Peace of Utrecht, on Purcell’s
<cite><span lang="la">Te Deum</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>After arriving in London he wrote <cite>Rinaldo</cite> with an Italian
libretto in fourteen days! He was the speed maniac
of the 17th and 18th centuries. His librettist said of him,
“Mr. Handel barely allowed me time to compose my
verses.” Later he arranged <cite>Rinaldo</cite> for harpsichord and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>all England played it, especially the lovely aria <cite><span lang="it">Lascia
ch’io Piango</span></cite> (Let Me Weep).</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet Handel doesn’t seem to have made money out of
<cite>Rinaldo</cite>, which brought the publisher, Walsh, $10,000,
about which Handel said, “My dear fellow, the next time
you shall compose the opera and I will publish it.” (<cite>History
of Music</cite>, by Paul Landormy.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, he became the guest of the Duke of Chandos,
at whose house he wrote at least sixteen compositions.</p>

<p class='c008'>King George had been very angry with Handel for leaving
Hanover and remaining in England, but forgave him
later, and Handel was made Director of the Royal Academy
of Music which the King founded in 1719. Among
Handel’s duties were the getting of the artists for the operas.
This meant much to him and allowed him to travel
all over Europe. He composed operas almost as people
wrote their letters, for in eight years he produced eleven
successful operas! Think of that for work!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Handel and His Rivals</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>But—he had a rival, Battista Buononcini, protégé of
the mighty Duke of Marlborough, and a musical war
raged in London. John Byrom, a humorist of the day
wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Some say, as compared to Buononcini</div>
      <div class='line'>That Mynheer Handel’s but a ninny</div>
      <div class='line'>Others aver that he to Handel</div>
      <div class='line'>Is scarcely fit to hold a candle.</div>
      <div class='line'>Strange all this difference should be</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Handel won, however, and Buononcini left England. In
1729, another opera venture was started, an Italian opera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>society, of which Handel was made the Director. Off he
went to Dresden and brought back Senesino, a tenor, and
other famous singers. But Handel did not get along well
with his singers and subordinates. He was too high-handed
and because of his quarrels the opera was given up! On
one occasion he dragged the singer, Cuzzoni, to the window
and threatened to throw her out if she did not sing the
way he wished. Various other reasons were given too,—one,
the dispute between Cuzzoni, who was called the
“Golden Lyre” and another soprano, Faustina, the wife
of Hasse, a rival conductor. Colley Cibber, a critic of
the time said: “These costly canary birds contaminate
the whole music loving public with their virulent bickerings.
Cæsar and Pompey did not excite the Romans to more
violent partisanship than these contentious women.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And now we see Handel bankrupt and superseded in
another theatre by his two rivals, Porpora and then Hasse
(1699–1783) of Hamburg. However, they too were unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c008'>On went Handel, writing operas and oratorios and conducting
at special functions. His health snapped, but his
will was so powerful that this forceful man recovered, and
presented two more operas, which were not successful. In
spite of all his failures and lack of tact, he had faithful
friends who arranged a successful benefit concert in 1738
for him. At about the same time a statue was erected in
Vauxhall Gardens, an honor never before paid to a living
composer!</p>

<p class='c008'>He composed, while writing for the stage all these years,
twelve sonatas for violin or flute with figured bass, thirteen
sonatas for two violins, oboes or flutes and bass, six
<i><span lang="it">concerti grossi</span></i>, twenty organ concertos and twelve concertos
for strings, many suites, fantasies and fugues for harpsichord
and organ. It is difficult to understand how one
brain could do all this!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Handel Forsakes Opera</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>After his ill success with the Italian Opera House, he
gave up writing operas and devoted himself to oratorios.
In thirteen years (1739–1752) he wrote nineteen. Among
these are <cite>Saul</cite> in which is the famous “Dead March,”
<cite>Joseph</cite>, and many other important ones, but towering over
all <cite>The Messiah</cite>, and <cite>Heracles</cite>, which Romain Roland says
is “one of the artistic summits of the 18th century.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They are not all oratorios, for <cite>Heracles</cite> and several others
are not religious in subject, but are dramatic epics.</p>

<p class='c008'>Handel’s sight failed him, but even this did not stop his
torrential activity to his death in 1759.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had become an English subject, so was buried with
pomp at Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was loved even though he was fiery of temper, and
had a will that no one could conquer.</p>

<p class='c008'>His music is full of his gusts of feeling but always
correct and his art perfect. In his work he always held
himself under great control and it mirrors his power and
balance. He loved wind instruments and people often
considered his music noisy!</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote forty-two operas, two passions, ninety-four
cantatas, ten pasticcios, serenatas, songs and the instrumental
works mentioned above. The famous Handel <cite><span lang="es">Largo</span></cite>
comes from one of his operas, <cite>Xerxes</cite>, and was an aria <cite>Ombra
mai fu</cite> (Never was there a Shadow).</p>

<p class='c008'>Handel used counterpoint, but always knew when to
unbend and use delightful flowing melody, so he became
popular.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other men, Hasse, Telemann and Graun, contemporaries
of Handel, followed the popular Italian models
but without Handel’s genius for melody and sublimity,
and were never heard of after their own generation had
passed away.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Handel’s <cite>Messiah</cite>, which he wrote in twenty-four days,
was first given in Dublin. It took the people by storm and
when the king heard it, thrilled by the “Hallelujah Chorus,”
he rose to his feet, and since then it is the custom to stand
during that number. It has become the Christmas Oratorio
and is sung in churches and societies all over the
world. It has lost none of its first popularity among the
people and is loved as few works have ever been. It thrills
because it is sincere, big, and arouses religious feeling.
Oratorio was his special gift to the world and one never
hears the name of Handel without thinking of <cite>The Messiah</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Handel seemed to reunite the forms: oratorio and opera,
under his massive will. At first some of his oratorios were
given in costume, showing the influence of opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Handel had many enemies in England, but he also had
friends. Although imperious, he had a sweet side, and
made friends with humble folk who loved music, even
though he hobnobbed with royalty. Thomas Britton, a
coal heaver, his friend, is sketched by an artist of the day
in a picture where Handel is playing <cite>The Harmonious Blacksmith</cite>
to Alexander Pope, the Duchess of Queensbury,
Colley Cibber and other famous folk. Yet he stormed at
everyone and even royalty “quaked in their boots” and
were forced to behave themselves at rehearsals and concerts
which Handel directed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Accused of using someone’s melody, he answered, “That
pig couldn’t use such a melody as well as I could!” He
helped himself to so many that he was called the “Great
Plagiarist.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His latter life was spent quietly, with a few intimate
friends, drinking his beer and smoking his beloved pipe.
He was always generous and as he grew older seemed to
become kindlier and softer. He contributed largely to
the Foundling Asylum and even played the organ there.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wanted to die on Good Friday, “in hopes,” he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“of meeting his good God, his sweet Lord and Saviour on
the day of his resurrection,” and on Good Friday, April
6th, 1759, he died.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Christoph Willibald Gluck—Father of Modern Opera</span><br> 1714–1787</h4>

<p class='c018'>Now we come to the next genius, Christoph Gluck (1714–1787)
born when George Frederick Handel was twenty-nine
years old. He also attacked the frivolous drift of
his time, but in another field from Handel and Bach, and
gave the fashionable, aimless Italian opera its death blow
for all time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gluck’s life is different from Handel, Bach, Haydn,
Mozart and Beethoven as you will see later when you have
read about all of these. For, until he was almost forty years
old, Gluck did nothing to make him great, whereas these
other men showed from their earliest years that they were
unusual.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gluck belongs to two periods for his life bridges Bach’s
and Haydn’s. You will see how he first belonged to the
frivolous fashion-loving composers like Hasse, Jomelli
and Piccinni, and how later he blossomed into the great
renewer and constructor of opera and escapes into a class
of his own! His is the most remarkable instance of a man
who starts with an ordinary talent, and later in life grasps
a vision that never came to him in his early youth and
which was not caught by others in his day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Furthermore he was able to carry his point and not
merely see the vision and let it go by. But first let us see
how his life unfolded, for a man’s life helps us to understand
his works.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Christoph Willibald Gluck, born July 2nd, 1714, at
Weidenwang, near Nüremberg, was the son of a gamekeeper,
who moved from estate to estate in the service of
princes and nobles, and at the time of Christoph’s birth,
was ranger to Eugene, Prince of Savoy. So, this little
boy destined to become the great Chevalier von Gluck,
was a child of the people even as was Haydn and others.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Gluck Starts Traveling</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When he was three years old he was taken to Bohemia,
(now Czecho-Slovakia), for his father entered the service of
Prince Lobkowitz, a great music lover, of whom you will
hear again. His parents were quite poor, yet it is remarkable
that above everything else they gave Christoph a
good education and at twelve he went to a Jesuit school
near Eisenberg, the home of Prince Lobkowitz.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here he learned to sing and to play the organ, the violin,
the ’cello and the clavier. He was diligent and became
most proficient and was loved and admired by the school
fathers. But little did they dream that some day he was
to write classic operas, based not on Christian stories but
the pagan dramas of the Greeks!</p>

<p class='c008'>When nearly nineteen, he left the seminary and said
good-bye to the Church of St. Ignatius and went to Prague.
To support himself and to carry on his scientific and musical
studies he gave lessons, played for rustic festivals and
earned money the best way he could, until Prince Lobkowitz
became interested in him and introduced him to the
musical circle at court. Here he met Count Melzi who
took him to Milan, where he was taught by Giovanni
Battista Sammartini, a celebrated organist and teacher of
counterpoint. After four years of study he completed his
musical education.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Milan, he wrote his first opera, <cite>Artaserse</cite> which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>performed in 1741. Metastasio, the popular librettist,
wrote the words to <cite>Artaserse</cite>, as he did for many of Gluck’s
works written in the loose style of the Italian opera. He
was now twenty-eight and in the five years spent here, he
composed eight operas, through which he gained great
popularity. But not yet had it come to him to revolutionize
opera; he simply used the old pattern which was really
nothing but groups of songs, recitatives and choruses having
very little connection except to give the performers the
chance to do musical feats to amaze the audience with their
skill. The story of these operas, meagre as it was, stopped
short, for some long and elaborate cadenza, and then it
went on again with no thought of the meaning of the
drama but rather to tickle the taste of the audience and
the performer. The orchestra, too, was a step-child, for
no one cared where it came in as long as it was politely
subdued, keeping the singers on the key, and doing its
best to be heard only when bidden. So, Gluck followed
these ideas in the beginning and perhaps it was better
that he did, otherwise he might never have realized how far
opera had strayed from the ideals of Monteverde.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having eight operas to his credit, he began to get commissions
from other cities and countries, and next accepted
an invitation, in 1745, to go to London as composer of opera
at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1746 he wrote <cite>La Caduta de
Giganti</cite> (The Fall of the Giants), with no doubt a libretto
of Metastasio’s, then he gave his <cite>Artamene</cite> and was assisted
in their production by Handel, who is supposed to
have treated the works with contempt. He is said to have
exclaimed, “Even my shoe-black can write better counterpoint
than Gluck.” But we must remember that Gluck
had not yet become the <em>great</em> Gluck. His visit to England
was fruitful, for Gluck heard and digested the great oratorios
of Handel, and realized that the voice and orchestra
might be handled the same way in opera. No doubt his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>mission was beginning to dawn on him; it came, not as a
great revelation, but gradually.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>He Makes Success of Failure</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Another thing that gave him a push forward and shows
how great people can make a success of failure: he was
asked to write a <i><span lang="it">pasticcio</span></i> (Italian word meaning a meat-pie),
or a string of melodies, very fashionable in his day. He
strung together his best airs from his Italian operas, and
called it <cite>Pyramus and Thisbe</cite>, but it was a dismal failure.
“Ah, ha!” he must have thought, “why shouldn’t this
musical drivel fail, for it is naught but trash, and with
nothing that is needed to make a good literary drama.”
So this was one of the experiences that led him to reform
opera, making the words fit the music and not stopping a
performance, so that a popular soloist could sing a meaningless
trill and then start again with the other part of the
word,—the way that opera was being written at that
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>After his London ups and downs he went to Paris and
heard the operas of Rameau. He realized now the value of
musical declamation and recitative to the meaning and
action of opera if used with thought, and he was not slow
in taking suggestions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gluck was probably the most all round man of his day,
for he knew literature and science as did few musicians.
He knew all the influential people in the arts, sciences, and
music in London, Hamburg, Dresden and Vienna, and his
home was a center of learned and delightful people. When
in Vienna but a short time, he was commissioned to write an
opera and he produced, with success, <cite><span lang="it">La Semiramide</span></cite>, after
which he went to Copenhagen. His next opera <cite>Telemacco</cite>
in which he began to work out his new ideas was well received,
in Rome and Naples.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>In 1750 after many disappointments, he was married to
a lady he had long adored. They lived happily together,
for Marriane Pergin not only brought him money which
was a great joy, but was always his devoted and understanding
help-mate. She was an accomplished woman,
and a companion that many might envy. But, sad to say,
they had no children, so they adopted a niece of Christoph’s,
a lovely little girl with great musical talent. The
three lived lovingly together until the poor little child
sickened and died, making the Glucks most unhappy,
for they adored her, as is often the case, even more than
if she had been their own child.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1751 Gluck journeyed to Naples. Didn’t he travel a
lot in the days of the stage coach and brigands! In the
same year he became conductor to Prince Frederick at
Vienna and in 1754 was officially attached to the opera,
and Maria Theresa made him court chapel master.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after, the Pope, pleased with what he had done in
Rome, made him Chevalier of the Golden Spur and from
that time he always styled himself Ritter (Chevalier)
von Gluck.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite><span lang="it">Il re pastore</span></cite> (The Shepherd King), we see the dawning
of Gluck’s best period of writing (1756). The overture
is better music than he had written before, and from this
time on, Gluck became the genius in the opera world for
which he is known. From 1756 to 1760 he lived apart
from the world studying and after this he began to broadcast
his ideas in writing and composing.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Archduke Joseph of Austria, afterwards the
Emperor, married Isabella of Bourbon, Gluck wrote <cite>Tetede</cite>
which was performed with great pomp. After this he
wrote the ballet <cite>Don Giovanni</cite>, or <cite>The Libertine</cite>, particularly
interesting, for it certainly gave Mozart an idea for
his own great work <cite>Don Giovanni</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again our “wandering minstrel” moved, this time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Bologna where he conducted a new opera which, strange
to say, showed not a sign of his new ideas!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>“Orpheus and Euridice” is Born</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Soon he met Calzabigi, another librettist, with whom he
wrote his first epoch-making opera <cite>Orpheus and Euridice</cite>.
Although in some parts it is written like the older operas,
he used many of his new ideas. The public at first were
bewildered but they liked it. The next opera written with
his new librettist was <cite>Alceste</cite>, so different was it, and so
full of his best thought that the public did not like it.
The pleasure-loving people went to be amused and heard
music almost as serious as oratorio. It was austere, and
its climax was not satisfactory. Yet it and <cite>Orpheus and
Euridice</cite> mark the birth of music drama which Mozart
and Wagner developed further.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite>Orpheus and Euridice</cite> the chorus was an important
part of the drama as it had been in the old Greek drama
from which Gluck took many of his stories; and was not
something dragged in to fill up space. Instead, too, of the
over-embroidered arias they were simple and expressive,
and the characters were real living beings, instead of figures
on which to drape showy melodies. Naturally, the
composers were jealous of him and went so far as to
say that the principal singer had written <cite>Orpheus and
Euridice</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gluck said of his <cite>Alceste</cite>: “I seek to put music to its
true purpose; that is, to support the poem, and thus to
strengthen the expression of the feelings and the interest
of the situation without interrupting the action....
In short, I have striven to abolish all those bad habits
which sound reasoning and true taste have been struggling
against now for so long in vain.” He abolished the unnecessary
cadenza, a fancy, trilly part composed by the soloist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>himself and used just before the close of a piece. You will
see in a later chapter how Beethoven dealt with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Happily Gluck and Calzabigi still continued working
together and in 1770 he wrote <cite>Paride and Elena</cite> (Paris and
Helen) which proved Gluck to be a writer of beautiful
romantic song.</p>

<p class='c008'>By now Vienna and Paris were enthusiastic about him,
yet he was severely criticized because he dared to write
and compose differently from everyone else. The adventurer
into new paths must always expect trouble from those
who have not caught up with him.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Trouble Brews for Gluck</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Now our traveler goes to Paris where he presents <cite>Iphigenia
in Aulis</cite>. The story was taken from a play of the
French dramatist Racine. Although this was the fourth
work in Gluck’s new style it was not as good as the others.
His enemies did their utmost to hurt him as they resented
his coming into Paris to reform French opera. And as
the musicians and singers were not good artists, it was
almost impossible to give it well, and probably it would
never have reached the stage had it not been for Marie
Antoinette the French Queen who was later guillotined.
She had been a real friend and pupil of Gluck, when a
young princess in Vienna. Nevertheless the opera pleased
its audiences, and it paid well, and Gluck was given a new
court office in Vienna.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1776 the trouble that had been brewing with Gluck’s
opponents came to a climax. Piccinni was his great Italian
rival and the city of Paris was torn as to who was the
better composer. All the literary men and the court were
divided into factions, one for and one against Gluck.
Some great men, including Jean Jacques Rousseau were
Gluckists, while others of importance were Piccinnists.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Never had there been so great a contention for musical
glory or struggle against new ideas. It was a most extraordinary
thing, but it does show that there was great musical
interest or people would never have wasted so much
time in argument and in writing for or against these men.
Finally it came to a head, and it was decided to give them
both the same libretto of <cite><span lang="la">Iphigenia in Tauris</span></cite> to see who
could write the better opera. Gluck completed his within
the year and after nearly three years, Piccinni finished his.
They were both performed and needless to say Gluck won
the award and even Piccinni said himself that Gluck’s was
the better. It is nice to know that after Gluck’s death,
Piccinni tried to collect funds to raise a memorial as a
tribute to him! So artistic rivalry need not dim admiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite><span lang="la">Iphigenia in Tauris</span></cite> again the master rises to great
heights. His overture was splendid, his orchestral color
was superb. He pictured the different characteristics of
the various groups of people and of the individuals themselves
in word and music as it never had been done before.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote <cite>Armide</cite> in 1777. It did not succeed although
it was very lovely and dreamy and in it, he suggested the
sounds of babbling brooks and the song of the nightingales.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gluck wrote thirty operas, seven of which are in his
new style: <cite>Don Giovanni</cite>, <cite>Orpheus and Euridice</cite>, <cite>Paris and
Helen</cite>, <cite>Alceste</cite>, <cite><span lang="la">Iphigenia in Tauris</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="la">Iphigenia in Aulis</span></cite> and
<cite>Armide</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>New Paths</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>And thus this great path-breaker advanced <em>opera seria</em>
(grand opera).</p>

<p class='c008'>The old <em>sinfonia</em> in three movements which opened the
opera, disappeared, and instead came the introduction or
overture, suggesting the opera itself. He taught and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>wrote that composers could do anything to assist the action
of the opera; he elevated the story to an important place;
the characters in the plot were thought of as people and
not as puppets, and they were studied individually and
not as machinery only. The situations in the story governed
the kind of music he used and he tried hard to make
the orchestra a main part of the opera. It seems odd that
nobody had thought of this before. Yet you have seen
how much time had been given to the voice throughout the
ages, and how long it had taken instruments to arrive at
their full importance. So we see Gluck improving as he
worked with a better librettist. From now the opera
writer had to use thought in composition, as he would in
writing a play.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A Very Cross Conductor!</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>But Gluck had trouble with the singers on account of
his innovations. He was the crossest conductor of his time,
would allow no one to dictate to him, and scolded the
singers as they had never been scolded before.</p>

<p class='c008'>He must have looked droll conducting, for he used to
take off his wig during rehearsals, and wrap a cloth about
his head to keep the draughts from fanning him! He
would rage if the singers tried to do what they had been
permitted to do in other operas! Some singers demanded
extra pay when Gluck conducted. Sometimes he would
repeat a passage twenty or thirty times and no <em>pianissimo</em>
was soft enough and no <i><span lang="it">fortissimo</span></i> loud enough! Someone
said of him while he was conducting, “He lives and dies
with his heroines, he rages with Achilles, weeps with
Iphigenia and in the dying scene of <cite>Alceste</cite> throws himself
back in his chair and becomes as a corpse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Otherwise he was always the kind soul who attracted
everybody from Marie Antoinette down. She used to receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>him in her boudoir so that they could enjoy conversation
without court formalities.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day two prima donnas refused to obey him when
rehearsing <cite>Iphigenia</cite>, and he said: “Mesdemoiselles, I
have been summoned here to Paris especially to produce
<cite>Iphigenia</cite>. If you sing, well and good, but if not, that
is your business; only I shall then seek an audience with
the Queen, and inform her that the opera cannot be performed,
and I shall put myself into my carriage and straightway
leave for Vienna.” You may know that the ladies
did their best!</p>

<p class='c008'>In closing let us tell you what Berlioz, a master of orchestration,
said of Gluck’s orchestration in <cite>Alceste</cite>: “Of its
kind I know nothing more dramatic, nothing more terror-inspiring.”
And this was said of a man who had only
the simplest orchestra with which to work. After much
fighting, he was the first to introduce into the orchestra
the kettle-drums and cymbals, which moderns have used
with grandeur.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gluck lived to see his own success, but the Piccinni strife
and the jealousies may have weakened his constitution,
for he died rather suddenly in 1787, a few weeks after the
first performance of Mozart’s <cite>Don Giovanni</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are many memorials in Europe to Gluck, not the
least being his bust which stands beside Lully and Rameau
in the Grand Opera of Paris.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Public Concerts</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is very hard to realize that time was when there were
no public concerts. Music was confined for so many centuries
to the churches, to the public squares, to the King’s
Chamber, or to the ball rooms of wealthy nobles, that it
had not become the democratic art that it is now. Of
course the first opera houses in Italy had been steps in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>direction of bringing music to the people. The concerts
begun by the Danish organist, Buxtehude, in Lübeck about
1673, and the <i><span lang="de">Tonkünstler-societät</span></i> in Vienna of the same
period were the first public concerts. In England, John
Banister started concerts at about the same time, which
were the first to admit an audience by payment of a fee.
Handel’s friend, Thomas Britton, the coal-heaver, gave
concerts at his home for 10 shillings the series!</p>

<p class='c008'>The 18th century saw a great development in giving public
concerts. In France, the <i><span lang="fr">Concerts Spirituels</span></i> were begun
in 1725. The object of these were to give music to the
people on the days of religious festivals when the opera
house was closed. There were about 24 concerts a year;
the political events of 1791 put an end to the society but it
had already given the people a taste for concerts, and many
new societies grew out of it. The festivals of Three Choirs
in West England (see page <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>) were founded in 1724, and
the Academy of Ancient Music in 1710. The <i><span lang="de">Musikverein</span></i>
in Leipsic was founded in 1743 and was later turned into
the famous <em>Gewandhaus</em> concerts in 1781.</p>

<p class='c008'>This movement for public concerts went hand in hand
with the development of instruments and the perfecting of
performers. In fact the word concert came from “<em>consort</em>—the
union or <em>symphony</em> of various instruments playing in
concert to one tune.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Mannheim School</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The symphony came to life in Germany. Paul Landormy
in his <cite>History of Music</cite> tells us that it was the time of
the “poor scholars” who were educated free from expense
in the schools with the understanding that they were to
learn the “musician’s trade” and take part in the concerts
organized by the cities and the courts. Thus symphony
orchestras grew up all over Germany,—Munich, Stuttgart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Dresden, Darmstadt, Hamburg where Telemann conducted,
in Leipsic, Berlin and Mannheim.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Mannheim appeared the most important group of
composers, known as the <em>Mannheim School</em>, and many wrote
the early symphonies which led from the works of Bach
to those of Haydn and Mozart. The best known of these
composers are: Johann Stamitz (1717–1757), Franz Xavier
Richter (1709–1789), Anton Filtz, Christian Cannabich,
Ignaz Holzbauer, Ernst Eichner and Giovanni Battista
Toeschi. Under the direct influence of the Mannheim
School were: François Joseph Gossec (1734–1829), a Belgian
living in Paris who wrote many symphonies; Luigi
Boccherini (1743–1805) known as one of the first writers of
chamber music in the form used by the classic writers;
Giovanni Battista Sammartini (1701–1775) of Milan; the
sons of Bach, Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf, and Joseph and
Michael Haydn.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XX<br> <span class='c016'>“Papa” Haydn and Mozart—the Genius</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>Franz Joseph Haydn</span><br> 1732–1809</h4>

<p class='c018'>About the time in history when Franz Joseph Haydn
was born, the world was very much upset. No one
knew what to think or how. It was a time of battle and
struggle as he was born in the midst of the Seven Years’
War and lived during the French Revolution. Everyone
except for a few great persons felt bitter and discontented
and doubt was everywhere. This seems to be the way
wars and conflicts affect all peoples and it is why wars are
so damaging.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet out of this mixture of feeling and thinking, the great
classic period of music was created by such men as Bach
and Haydn and Mozart and the finishing touches were
put on it by Beethoven, the colossus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Franz Joseph Haydn was born in Rohrau (1732), a little
town in Austria near Vienna. His father was a wheelwright
and his mother was a very good cook. Beethoven’s
mother, too, was a professional cook.</p>

<p class='c008'>These simple parents, his brothers and sisters, measuring
not a baker’s, but a wheelwright’s dozen, had an hour
or two of music every evening after the hard day’s work,
and Mathias, the father, played the harp and sang. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>during these evenings that little Joseph’s father noticed
that at the age of six he was passionately fond of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>One time at a festival the drummer failed to appear
and there was no one who could play for the choristers
who were to march through the town. His teacher, Frankh,
called Joseph and showed him how to make the drum
stroke and told him to practice it. When he was left by
himself he found a meal tub, over which he stretched a
cloth, put it on a stool and drummed with such vigor that
the whole thing toppled over and he and his drum were
covered with meal! But he learned to drum! And the
people laughed when in this solemn church festival, the
little six year old Joseph was seen drumming the big drum
carried by a hunchback in front of him. The drums on
which he played are still at Hainburg. But, we forget, we
have not brought him from Rohrau!</p>

<p class='c008'>Not long before J. M. Frankh, a relative, came to visit
the Haydns, and it was decided that he should take Joseph
to Hainburg to teach him. The excitement, of course,
was great and little Joseph felt very important with all
the hustle and bustle preparing for his departure. Little
did Saperle (his nickname) realize what a hard master he
was getting in Frankh, who only cared for the pay he
received from Joseph’s father. Nevertheless he learned
much and showed great talent while at Hainburg and one
day a great thing happened. Reutter, the organist of
St. Stephen’s in Vienna, visited Frankh and as they talked
of music the conversation turned to the choir school which
Reutter directed. Frankh sent for Joseph, a slight, dark
haired, dark eyed little boy, and Reutter asked him to
read a piece of music at sight. Joseph looked at it and said:
“How can I, when my teacher couldn’t?” Yet, Joseph
did sing it sweetly and he entered the choir school. Here
his life was a misery, for Reutter was harsh and unsympathetic,
but soon Joseph’s hard life in the choir school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>was over, for one very cold winter night, he felt a little
frisky, as many a healthy lad does, and pulled off the wig
of a man in the choir. Reutter, who had wanted an excuse
to rid himself of Joseph, because his voice had begun to
break, threw him out into the cold. Poor Saperle had no
other place to go and wandered about all night, until he
met his acquaintance Spangler, a tenor who was very poor
and so had sympathy with Haydn. He took him home to
live with him and his wife and child in his attic,—one
small room with no comfort and no privacy. All this time
young Haydn was forced to earn his daily bread by teaching
as much as he could, playing for weddings, baptisms,
funerals, festivals, dances and street serenadings. This
street serenading was a sweet and pretty custom of the
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>One night Haydn and some other youths serenaded Kurz,
a prominent comedian. Kurz, pleased by the music below
his window, called to the lads: “Whose music is that?”
“Joseph Haydn’s,” called back Haydn. “Who is he and
where?” asked Kurz. “Down here, I am Haydn,” said
Joseph. Kurz invited him upstairs and Haydn, at the age
of seventeen, received a commission for a comic opera,
which had two special performances.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this time he mixed with the poor and laboring people,
and their songs became his songs, and his heart was full
of their frolics and their pains. He was of the people and
was so filled with their humor that later he was called the
father of humor in music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon, in order to be alone, and to work in peace, he
took a room in another attic, and bade good-bye to his
very good friends. His room was cold in winter and let in
the rains and snows, but it did have a spinet on which
Haydn was allowed to play, and fortunately Metastasio
the librettist lived in this house. Here Haydn studied the
works of Karl Philip Emanuel Bach, Fuchs’ <cite><span lang="la">Gradus ad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Parnassum</span></cite> (Steps to Parnassus, Parnassus meaning the
mountain upon which the Greek Muses lived and so comes
to mean the home of learning). He practised too, during
this time, on any instrument he could find and learned so
much that he became the founder of the modern orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Metastasio discovered that there was a hard
working musician in his house he met him and then introduced
him to Porpora the greatest Italian singing teacher
in Vienna. Not long after meeting him, Porpora entrusted
to his care Marianne Van Martines, his ten year old pupil,
the future musical celebrity. At seventeen Marianne
wrote a mass which was used at St. Michael’s Church and
she became the favorite singer and player of Empress
Maria Theresa. You see women even in those days composed
and performed!</p>

<p class='c008'>So began Haydn’s successes. Porpora engaged him as
accompanist, and treated him half way between a valet
and a musician, but Haydn’s sweet nature carried him
through all unpleasantnesses and he was so anxious to
learn and to earn his six ducats that he did not care if he
did have to eat with the servants.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1751–2, he wrote his first mass, his first string quartet,
and his first comic opera for Kurz, <cite>The Crooked Devil</cite>, the
music of which has been lost. Soon after he met Gluck
at the concerts of the Prince of Hildburghausen, where
Haydn acted as accompanist; at the prince’s house too,
he met Ditter von Dittersdorf, the violinist. The princes
and nobles of these days did much for music for it was usually
at their homes and under their guidance that the composers
received opportunities to work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, we see Haydn during these days slaving
to make his daily bread, but with the money he made he
bought books on music theory and held himself sternly
down to hard work, morning, noon, and night.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1755 Baron von Fürnburg, a music amateur, who gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>concerts at his home, asked him to compose for him, and
he wrote eighteen quartets, six <i><span lang="it">scherzandi</span></i> for wind instruments
(the ancestors of his own symphonies), four string
quartets, to be played by the village priest, himself, the
steward, and the ’cellist Albrechtsberger.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these pieces show how much happier he was since
becoming part of the Baron’s staff, for they are merry and
jolly, and filled with that humor which Haydn was the
first to put into music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, too, he met the cultivated Countess Thun, who was
so interested in his struggle for success, and in the youth himself
that she became his pupil. From this time on he began
to earn more and to live more comfortably.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everything seemed to be clearing up for him now. The
Countess introduced him to Count Morzin, a Bohemian
nobleman of great wealth, and in 1759 he became his musical
director. His orchestra had eighteen members and
here he wrote his first Symphony (the first of one hundred
and twenty-five!)</p>

<p class='c008'>All this time he kept up his teaching and very soon married
the daughter of a wig-maker, who did not understand
him and with whom he was very unhappy, but he lived
with her like the good man he was until within a few years
of his death.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Haydn and the Esterhazys</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Soon after Haydn’s marriage, Count Morzin had to cut
down expenses and dismissed his musical staff, but Prince
Paul Anton Esterhazy engaged him and he lived with him
thirty years under salary with all his expenses paid,—thus
ended his struggles to make a living. He composed in
comfort and had a few able musicians to play whatever
he wrote. He had quiet, solitude and appreciation,—the
need of all art workers.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>From 1761 to 1790 in the Esterhazy home he wrote most
of his immortal works,—six of his best symphonies; the
oratorio <cite>The Seven Words from the Cross</cite> (1785) which
he himself thought was a masterpiece; six string quartets.</p>

<p class='c008'>His orchestra here had six violins and violas, one violoncello,
one double bass, one flute, two oboes, two bassoons
and four horns,—seventeen in all; later he had twenty-two
to twenty-four including trumpets, kettle-drums and
from 1776–1778 the newest arrival, the clarinet.</p>

<p class='c008'>His duties were to rehearse the orchestra daily, give
music lessons, compose for the orchestra and instruct
the singers engaged by the prince. Oh, yes! he had to tune
his own harpsichord, on which he played when he led the
orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haydn led a beautiful life with the Esterhazy family.
In the summer he hunted and fished, and in the winter,
went off to Vienna to hear the orchestra and meet great
personages attracted by the art, music and court life.
But he had to keep on composing for the Esterhazys, who
were constantly entertaining and there were many special
occasions to be celebrated with Haydn’s lovely music.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems hard for us to realize that one family could play
the compositions of one man continually, but we have
rarely had so great a man to listen to!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Haydn in England</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In 1790 Haydn’s fame had spread abroad, especially to
England. Salomon, a violinist and concert manager
begged him to come to conduct twenty concerts with a
new composition for each concert, for which he was to
receive a fabulous sum. He gave his first concert February
25th, 1791. He was now about sixty years old and
his popularity was so great that the Prince of Wales engaged
him for twenty-six court concerts. He forgot to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>pay him, but later Parliament sent him one hundred
guineas (about $500). Money at that time bought four
or five times what it buys now, so Haydn went back to
Austria, rich and famous and with a degree from Oxford.
The English asked him many times to return and finally
in 1794 he went again and was greeted with even more
enthusiasm. Few composers in all the world have lived to
see such triumphs as did the jovial, charming “Papa
Haydn,” as his warm friend and pupil Mozart called him.
But withal, Haydn was modest and unassuming and never
hesitated to give his services in concerts for the poor or
to give money to the sick.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides all the money he must have received, he had a
generous pension from his friends, the Esterhazys, who
demanded very little of his time. So now, with leisure, he
could do his greatest works and at this period he wrote
two oratorios, <cite>The Creation</cite> and <cite>The Seasons</cite>. They were
more than successful. Emil Naumann says this of <cite>The
Seasons</cite>: “It is not until we come to Haydn that we witness
the joys and sorrows of men and women of our own
time and dwellers in our own land, the tiller of the soil, the
wine-presser and shepherd, or homely figures like Simon
the farmer, his daughter Anna and the peasant Lucas, in
<cite>The Seasons</cite>.” Then he says of <cite>The Creation</cite>: “We move
with him through the German spinning room, where the
girls relate stories to the accompaniment of the musical
hum of the spinning wheel, or we rove through woods to
follow the chase. His whole heart is in nature. He loves
to depict her in her many varying aspects, and at all seasons,
and all is touched with a light, tender hand. His
types are of home.... His delineation of nature is
ever the same, fresh and loving, whether we look at <cite>The
Seasons</cite> or at <cite>The Creation</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Haydn said of his English experience, “It is England
which has made me famous in Germany.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>In 1797 he wrote <cite>God Preserve the Emperor</cite> which became
the Austrian National Hymn, and later put it in his
quartet called the Kaiser Quartet. From this time on,
nearly every nation honored him,—Russia, France, Sweden,
England, Austria, Germany. And as Haydn was
leaving for England, when Mozart said to him, “Papa,
you are scarcely fitted for such an undertaking, mixing
with the big world without the gift of language,” he replied,
“Aye, but <em>my</em> language is understood by the whole
world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And this is the keynote of Haydn’s greatness, his music
is and was understood by the whole world, so true and
simple and melodious is it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A Gala Performance</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One year before his death when he was seventy-six years
of age, he was so feeble that he had to be carried to the
concert hall where a great performance of <cite>The Creation</cite>
was given in his honor under the direction of Salieri, who
later taught Beethoven. Princes and nobles and grand
ladies did him homage and the ladies threw their beautiful
cloaks over his couch to keep him warm, for it was a cold
night in March, 1808. When that part of the oratorio
came where they sing, “And there was light,” it is said
that Haydn exclaimed, “Not I, but a power from above
created that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He died on May 30th, 1809, from shock, it is said, caused
by the booming of cannon near his house when the French
besieged Vienna.</p>

<p class='c008'>So passed this conscientious musician, whose belief is
summed up in these sentences: “I know that God appointed
me a task. I acknowledge it with thanks, and hope and
believe I have done my duty and have been useful to the
world. May others do likewise.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Haydn’s Gift to Music</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>1. He made over the orchestra, he discovered that
muted strings made a beautiful winning effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. He and Mozart at about the same time, added the
clarinet to the orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. He was the first composer who brought humor,
that difficult thing which is neither wit nor comicalness,
to music, although others had brought fun and boisterousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. He was the first to use the individual tone color of
each instrument, so, rightly he has been called the father
of the modern orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. He developed sonata-form in the sonata itself, the
quartet, concerto and symphony. He was one of the first
to establish two themes instead of one in the movements
of sonata-forms. This was a great innovation and
made the sonata a far more living thing and gave the
composers who followed him a richer field to carry out
musical design and human feeling.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. He wrote about 1,407 works! 157 symphonies of
which 18 are masterpieces, 83 string quartets, 66 piano
sonatas, 5 oratorios, 42 German and English songs, 336
Scotch songs, 40 canons, 13 part songs for three and four
voices, 5 German marionette operas written for the Esterhazy
theatre, 14 Italian operas, 163 pieces for the baryton
(viola da bordona), a favorite instrument of one of the
Esterhazy princes, 47 divertimenti and trios, 15 concertos
for different instruments, 15 masses, 5 other sacred
works, 400 single minuets and waltzes. (Emil Naumann.)</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Among his larger vocal works with orchestra are:
<cite>Alcide</cite> (1762), <cite>Philemon and Baucis</cite>, <em>entre acte</em> music for
King Lear and many others. His symphonies are so numerous
and so many in the same key that in order to tell
them apart some have been given such names as <cite>Surprise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Symphony</cite>, <cite>The Farewell Symphony</cite>, the <cite>Military Symphony</cite>,
<cite>Queen of France</cite>, <cite>The Oxford</cite>, the fascinating <cite><span lang="de">Kinder Symphonie</span></cite>
(children’s symphony) and on and on!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mozart and Haydn</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Mozart was years younger than Haydn and died while
still very young, but they were the closest friends. Haydn
was his teacher, but lived to think of Mozart as his superior
and didn’t hesitate to say so. This again shows the
great spirit of Haydn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although Haydn was an innovator and a master of
form his rules were never cast into molds he could not break
through inspiration. A critic once asked him about the
introduction to the Mozart Quartet in C major which had
been much discussed on account of its complex harmonies,—a
work which today we look upon as one of the greatest
examples of his genius. Haydn replied in a decided tone,
“If Mozart has written it, be sure he had good reason for
so doing.” Albrechtsberger, a strict technician, questioned
him about the use of consecutive fourths which was breaking
a good old-fashioned law of harmony. Haydn replied,
“Art is free and must not be fettered by handicraft rule.
The cultivated ear must decide, and I believe myself as
capable as any one of making laws in this respect.” Thus
spoke the great musician and not just the teacher and
follower.</p>

<p class='c008'>He loved his art so well that he welcomed the young
Mozart to Vienna generously, because of his genius.
Haydn, when asked by a manager to have one of his
operas follow the night after one of Mozart’s refused,
saying: “It would be too much to venture, for next to the
great Mozart it would be difficult for anyone to stand.
Could I force home to every lover of music the grandeur
and inimitableness of Mozart’s operas,&#160;... and display
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>of genius, and were I able to impress all others with the
same feelings which excite me, the nations would contend
for the possession of so rare a gem. Let Prague strive to
hold fast the priceless man. But reward him adequately,
for without this the history of great men is truly sad and
offers to posterity little inducement to exertion, as indeed
many a hopeful mind lies fallow for want of encouragement.
It angers me <em>only</em> that Mozart has not yet been
engaged at some Imperial court. Pardon this digression
but I love the man dearly.” When he left Mozart he
wrote to his friend Frau von Gennzinger, “I am inconsolable
at parting,” and then he tells with the simplicity of a
child “a happy dream” he had listening to a performance
of Mozart’s <cite>Marriage of Figaro</cite>. (Adapted from
Naumann.)</p>

<p class='c008'>And thus we see this cheerful-hearted man according
honor and love even to his rivals, his broad realistic humor
showing itself, as well as charm, dignity and beauty, in
all his works whether in music or in life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Papa Haydn was a good and truly religious man. He
leaves us an example of kindliness and thoughtfulness,
for even the people who loaned him money, which he
repaid, were remembered in his will. A touching story is
told of him; that when he returned to his parent’s home, he
kissed the floor upon which his mother and father used to
walk, so well had he remembered them, yet so simple had
he remained, he who played among and played with and
played for the greatest people who lived in his time.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</span><br> 1756–1791</h4>

<p class='c018'>Now we come to the greatest musical genius of all time.
For, whereas Bach, Handel, Haydn, Gluck, and Beethoven
excelled in many things, Mozart excelled in everything;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>living but thirty-five years, about half the time of most
of these, he outstripped them all in natural genius.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wolfgang Amadeus, born in Salzburg on the 27th of
January, 1756, was the son of Leopold Mozart, under
chapel master to the hated Archbishop of Salzburg. His
mother was the daughter of a minor official in Hildenstein,
and was not a cook as were the mothers of Haydn and of
Beethoven. However, Madam Mozart’s not having been
of that profession did not lessen her son’s genius!</p>

<p class='c008'>One day when little Wolfgang was four years old, his
father found the boy busily writing. He warned his father
not to disturb him, as he was writing a concerto for the
harpsichord. And, sure enough, when the father looked
over the boy’s shoulder he saw that he was not scribbling
as most children of four years do, but was actually composing
a work for harpsichord and orchestra, which he afterwards
played to show how it should go. In spite of the blots
of ink, it could easily be read.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mozart’s father was a wise and kindly man. He soon
appreciated that the boy was destined for a great career,
and decided that he must be properly trained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wolfgang was a sweet and loving child, very kind and
easy to control, although he and his sister “Nannerl”
were “regular” children and loved to play as other children.
The father decided to take them both on a concert
tour through Europe, in order to meet the great musicians
and to earn money for their education.</p>

<p class='c008'>In May, 1765, Wolfgang and his pretty little sister gave
their first concert in London “for the benefit” so the sign
read, “of Miss Mozart aged thirteen and Master Mozart
eight years of age, prodigies of nature&#160;... a concert
of music, with all the overtures of this little boy’s composition.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The people, tired of all the pomp and ceremony of
fashion, were eager for something different and were ready
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>to listen to youthful prodigies, so the hall was crowded,
and everyone was amazed.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were beautifully brought up, charming, merry
and unspoiled by the gifts showered upon them. Father
Mozart gave the presents to them by degrees, teaching
them the value of all things, from jewels to flattery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because of this training, Mozart always remained modest,
did everything with gratitude to God and greatest
love for his parents. He was especially loving to Nannerl
to whom he brought every new idea. In fact Mozart
radiated friendship and love.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Children Tour Europe</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>On this concert tour (1765) in Paris, London, Holland
and Switzerland, Mozart was received with great enthusiasm
everywhere. When they came back, Mozart had no
time to become conceited for he began a strict course of
study and at twelve he composed his first mass and his
first opera <cite><span lang="fr">Bastien et Bastienne</span></cite>, which is still played and
is charming. At fourteen he was assistant concertmaster
to the Archbishop of Salzburg, and then began a series of
woes, for the Archbishop was a mean character and treated
him most unjustly.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, in 1777, we see him in Paris with his mother,
where to his great advantage he heard Gluck’s operas and
met Gluck. Shortly after that his mother died, and it
made a very deep scar in his heart. Soon he was absorbed
in composing and finishing <cite>Idomeneo</cite> and in this year
(1781) took up his residence in Vienna. In the next, he
married Constance Weber and wrote <cite><span lang="it">Il Seraglio</span></cite> in which
his heroine is called Constance. They say he was teased
for this, but he did not mind very much. In 1786 he wrote
the unexcelled <cite>Marriage of Figaro</cite>, which at first was not
appreciated, but soon came into its own.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Prague began to love Mozart and gave him ovations.
To show his appreciation he composed <cite>Don Giovanni</cite> (1787)
and so great was the people’s delight in this masterpiece
that Emperor Joseph made him court composer at the
salary of $400 a year! Too bad it was not more, for poor
Mozart was never free from the heart-breaking struggle
to make enough money to live. You will recall the letter
of Haydn in the last section where he wished some nation
would adopt Mozart and free him from care, so great was
Haydn’s appreciation and love for Mozart, which Mozart
returned. When listening to a piece of Haydn’s, a critic
once said: “I wouldn’t have written it like that, would
you?” “No,” replied Mozart, “and do you know why?
Because neither of us would have had the idea!” Isn’t it
refreshing to see men so great in wisdom and works that
they become greater because of their loyalties.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet this man, a genius almost divine, was so hated by
petty musicians, so badgered by unjust criticism, that
when he was dying he believed that someone had poisoned
him!</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of his enemies, he was known for his gaiety and
bubbling fun, which ever overflowed into his music. No
one seems to know why his country did not free him of
money worry.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Appreciation Comes Late</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>As it so often happens with great men, after his death
public subscriptions were collected and statues erected
as a tribute to his memory. At Salzburg you can see a
statue of him, and yearly festivals of his works are held
in his honor; and in Vienna, the opera house is decorated
with frescoes of scenes from the <cite>Magic Flute</cite>!</p>

<p class='c008'>After his visit to Prague he was never well, and when
he had finished the inimitable <cite>Magic Flute</cite> he started work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>on his last composition, the great Requiem (a mass played
for the dead) which influenced Catholic Church music for
years. He became very despondent, in great contrast to
his usual high spirits, and poor Constance did everything
to cheer him. One day, while writing the Requiem, Mozart
began to weep and declared he was writing it for himself,
“I feel I am not going to last much longer, some one has
certainly given me poison, I cannot get rid of this idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In November, being an ardent member of the Masonic
brotherhood, as were also Beethoven and Haydn, believing
as they did in the freedom and brotherhood of man, he
wrote a cantata and led it himself at his lodge. Ill and
despondent, he continued work on the Requiem, finished
while he was dying. All during this time he longed to hear
his <cite>Magic Flute</cite> which was constantly given at the opera
house, and like a child, he would say: “I guess they have
just reached this or that point,” and he would hum the
music as he thought it must be progressing at the opera.
The day before he died, Roser, his friend, played some of
the opera on the harpsichord to cheer him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The afternoon before his death, after finishing the
Requiem, he and some of his friends sang it. At the <cite>Lacrymosa</cite>,
Mozart wept. He said to Sussmayer, his friend,
“Did I not say I was writing the Requiem for myself?”
Later he asked his wife to tell Albrechtsberger of his approaching
end, so that he would be ready to take his post
at St. Stephen’s. During his last hours he was informed
that he had been made director of all the music at St.
Stephen’s with a salary that for the first time in his life
would have enabled him to live in comfort, but it was too
late! At midnight, on December 5th, 1791, he lost consciousness
and fell into a slumber from which he did not
awake. His wife was so overcome with grief that she
was too ill to attend his funeral. A few faithful friends
followed the coffin, but had to turn back as a furious tempest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>was raging and they could not force their way through
the driving rain and sleet. Thus passed one of the rarest
spirits that has ever brought Music to earth, and he lies
in a grave unknown and unmarked. In 1859, the city of
Vienna erected a monument to his memory near the spot
where he was probably buried.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sad, sad end for so great a man! He and Raphael,
Keats and Shelley and Jesus, Himself, all died early in their
careers and yet had time to leave the world a finer and
more lovely place for us.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mozart Prince of Musicians</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Why do we celebrate Mozart in what seems to be exaggerated
terms?</p>

<p class='c008'>Where Handel was a great epic composer, Bach a great
religious composer, Gluck, a dramatic writer, Haydn more
versatile than many of the others yet not dramatic,
Beethoven lyric, free and hating all tyrannies, in Mozart
we have great opera, great masses, great epics, symphonies
and chamber music quartets and quintets.</p>

<p class='c008'>The list of his works is gigantic! How he was able in the
short span of his life, to write down so much, to say nothing
of composing them, is a problem that cannot be solved!</p>

<p class='c008'>With his usual tendency not to finish work until the last
minute, he wrote the overture to <cite>Don Giovanni</cite> the night
before the first performance. He composed and scored it
for orchestra in less time that it took the copyists to copy
the parts, and the audience was forced to wait almost an
hour until Mozart appeared at the conductor’s stand to
direct the unrehearsed overture. When the curtain rose
on the first act Mozart said, “The overture went off very
well on the whole, although a good many notes certainly
fell under the desks!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mozart promised a group of country dances to a count,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>but failed to keep his word. The count invited him, putting
dinner time an hour ahead. When Mozart arrived he
was shown into a room, was given music paper, quills and
ink and was asked to compose, then and there, four country
dances to be performed the next evening. In a half
hour’s time he wrote the entire orchestra score and earned
his dinner!</p>

<p class='c008'>Mozart could be not only humorous, but tragic in the
same work, making his humor seem greater by contrast.
<cite>Don Giovanni</cite> and the <cite>Magic Flute</cite> could be called tragic-comedies
they are so rich in both moods.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <cite>Marriage of Figaro</cite> he originated what Emil Naumann
calls conversational opera, although Rossini’s <cite>Barber
of Seville</cite>, and Donizetti’s <cite>Daughter of the Regiment</cite> follow
it in style they do not reach it in real fun, melody and quality.
When we say some of his operas were humorous we
do not mean that they were comic operas.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite>Don Giovanni</cite> he originated romantic opera, and
although Weber in <cite>Oberon</cite> and other operas have their
fine moments, none approach the awe-inspiring, continuous
beauty of Mozart’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was the first to write a great fairy opera, <cite>The Magic
Flute</cite>, composed when he was writing the Requiem!
Although the librettist wrote it for money, Mozart wanted
it idealistic and true to his beliefs.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite><span lang="it">Cosi Fan Tutti</span></cite> (They’re All Alike) was really and truly
comic opera, and <cite>Titus</cite> shows his mastery of the formal
and severe style. So in all these he left models for those
who followed him. Had he done but this one thing he
would have been great indeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coming into the world when he did, he was the connecting
link between the old Italian opera and Gluck, who
idealized what the old Florentines did, on the one hand,
and the romantic and romantic comic opera of the later
masters of Germany and France, on the other.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>In instrumental music he is the link between Haydn
and Beethoven. Let us see how! He furthered the work
of Haydn in the quartets and quintets by making them
more human and more expressive of sorrow, pain, passionate
grief and the deeper things than Haydn. In his six quartets
dedicated to Haydn he says, “I labored over these.”
This does not agree with the usual statement, says Naumann,
“that he shook his music out of his sleeve.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Out of his forty-nine symphonies nine rank, some think,
with Beethoven’s nine! In the finale of the Jupiter symphony
he does so great a musical feat that as yet no one
has surpassed it. For in it he writes a fugue along with the
sonata form of the symphony, so spontaneous and so lovely
that even Bach himself could not have reached the freshness
of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mozart treated the fugue with the same limpid mirthfulness
that he used in less strict forms of music. This Beethoven
never achieved for his fugues were always a bit
labored, but Mozart was perfectly at home in contrapuntal
writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mozart also invented the art song! This is different
from the regular song for the music changes from verse to
verse to make the meaning of the poem or words more
expressive. Thus he paved the way for Schubert, Schumann,
Brahms and other great song writers, as he did for
the symphonist Beethoven and those born later.</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened the gate, not to a national art, but to an
international art, for he was a world figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>So, we leave Mozart, the Genius, for Beethoven, the
Colossus, who deepened and glorified music and gave it a
broader path along which to travel.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Let us see what was happening in the world into which
Beethoven was born.</p>

<p class='c008'>The French Revolution had closed the 1700s with blood
and terror, and the American Colonies were uneasy under
British rule, and before Beethoven was six, the American
Revolution was in full blast.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was another time like the Renaissance, when people
began to think for themselves. In other words, the individual
was commencing to count more than the nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slowly we see the idea die out that only the nobles and
the wealthy had the right to life, liberty and happiness,
and we see the ideas of freedom and equality taking the
place of serfdom and slavish obedience to over-lords.
All this may seem strange to appear in a book on music
but art always mirrors the life and feelings of the people
of its time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came Napoleon, who dragged the French army
through the continent of Europe, until he was defeated at
Waterloo by the English.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, too, came the War of 1812 between England and
America, and unrest seemed to be over the face of the
world.</p>

<p class='c008'>But through it all came the insistent demand of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>people for more democratic governments, and these new
demands grudgingly granted by monarchs caused revolts
and uprisings everywhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the time when men like Goethe, Schiller, Kant,
Fichte and other famous poets and philosophers did their
thinking and writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>And into this world, the great democrat, Beethoven,
came to add his contribution to life, liberty, and beauty,
as have few others of our race.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so the road is made easy for the people who followed
Beethoven,—Weber, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann
and Chopin, and later Wagner, who helped make the 19th
century, a great musical era.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Romanticism</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Instead, now, of people writing around a well known
song, as they did in the cantus-firmus days, originality
was the keynote; instead of conventional forms, composers
began to find new forms and to compose from the
heart; instead of writing dainty and graceful music, they
wrote music of power; instead of holding back what they
wanted to say, they poured out in rich melody their very
deepest, loveliest and most exalted feelings,—caring more
for what they felt themselves than for the effect on their
audiences. Instead, too, of mathematical rules, they
wrote themselves, their hopes and their fears into their
compositions, and this freedom is labeled the Romantic
Movement in Music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now appeared the great vocal and instrumental soloists
(virtuosi). They developed because of the advance in the
making of instruments. Beethoven could write more
richly with the piano he had, than if he had lived in Bach’s
time. For the advance in instruments helps the composer
and the composer, the instruments.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Since music became of age, we have seen many things
happen to it: the advance in instruments, of the orchestra,
and opera, and the development of the sonata and
symphony.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ludwig van Beethoven was the bridge between the
classic writers and those to follow him: Schubert, Schumann,
Mendelssohn, Chopin, and Liszt, members of the
“Romantic School.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before explaining what Beethoven did to advance
music, you must hear about his life, for he was so interesting
that knowing him will help you to understand his
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although born in Bonn, Germany, his ancestors on his
father’s side were of Dutch-Flemish stock like our old
friends, Okeghem and Willaert. You will notice that the
syllable before his last name is “van.” If his name had
been German, it would have been “von.” He was proud
of his Dutch origin and corrected anyone who misspelled
it. This frankness, you will see, was a part of his character.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>An Unhappy Boyhood</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>He was born December 16th, 1770, and his mother was
the chief cook in the Castle of Ehrenbreitstein. His father,
a tenor, and his grandfather were musicians in the band
of the Elector of Cologne at Bonn. His mother was sweet
and loving, but his father was unkind and intemperate.
According to some accounts, his boyhood was spent in
poverty and his father tried to drive him to earn money for
the family. It was very hard on Beethoven that his mother
should have died early in his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>At four years of age Ludwig’s father insisted upon his
learning to play the piano, and as he did not want to
practise, he was whipped often. Later he started to work
in earnest and in spite of hating it, played in public when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>he was eight and at eleven he had mastered Bach’s forty-eight
Preludes and Fugues, a difficult task even for a grown
up. Besides, he had written three piano sonatas published
in 1781. We think he wasted little time after his first
whippings!</p>

<p class='c008'>When thirteen, he went on the opera staff where he
played accompaniments for rehearsals, without pay. Not
a bad job for a lad!</p>

<p class='c008'>One of his first teachers was Pfeiffer, who belonged to
the opera troupe and boarded with the Beethovens. Beethoven
now was growing most enthusiastic about music
and took up the study of the organ. Not only this, but he
wrote a funeral cantata for organ, which excited the whole
town.</p>

<p class='c008'>He played the piano very beautifully, as did Mozart,
and when he went to Holland with his mother, at eleven,
he played at many private houses, and gained confidence
in himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Think of it! When Beethoven was twelve, Neefe, his
teacher and organist at Bonn, left town and Beethoven
took his place. This proves his great ability, because
playing for services was complicated. He was so successful
that Neefe prophesied he would become a second
Mozart!</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1787, Beethoven, despite his poverty, went to Vienna,
where Mozart said that he would “make a noise in the
world,” and gave the young pianist a few lessons. Not long
afterwards, Beethoven was recalled to Bonn where his life
was much saddened by the deaths of his mother and his
little sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this time he made the acquaintance of the von Bruening
family,—mother, three boys and a girl, whose friendship
was one of the inspiring events of his boyhood. He
gave lessons to Eleanore and to a brother, and was a close
friend to them all. Here he was introduced to the marvels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>of literature, which proved to be a lifelong love and a solace
for the sad hours after he became deaf. He also accompanied
the von Bruenings on holidays in the country, and
through them met Count Waldstein, a young noble and
amateur musician, who was most enthusiastic over Beethoven’s
budding talent. Through Count Waldstein he
was brought to the attention of the Elector of Bonn, who
gave the young musician a place as viola player in the
orchestra of his national theatre. Here he made several lifelong
friends,—Franz Ries, who probably taught him to
play the violin and viola, the two Rombergs, Simrock and
Stumpff. His old teacher Neefe, was pianist and stage
manager in the theatre.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now his home became most unhappy because of his
father’s drunkenness and bad habits. The Court, however,
in 1799, looked after Beethoven and saw that part
of his father’s salary was paid to him to help him care for
the family. In addition to this the money he earned by
playing and by giving lessons enabled him to support his
brothers and sister.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>He Meets Papa Haydn</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When Papa Haydn passed through Bonn on his way
to London, Beethoven went to visit him, and brought with
him, instead of candy or flowers, a cantata which he had
written for the occasion. Haydn was delighted with
him and offered to teach him if he would go to Vienna.
So, in 1792, on the advice of Count Waldstein, we see him
again in Vienna, studying counterpoint with Haydn. At
first he frankly imitated his master, and although he
leaned more toward Mozart’s colorfulness of style than
Haydn’s, from the older composer he learned how to
treat and develop themes, and how to write for the
orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>When Haydn left Vienna for his second visit to England,
Beethoven studied with Albrechtsberger, also with Schenck,
Salieri and Förster. Although he was an amazing student
his teachers were afraid of and for him, for his ideas were
ahead of his day. They failed to see in him the great pathfinder,
and naturally thought he was a dangerous radical
or “red” as we would say.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Beethoven’s Friendships</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The story of Beethoven’s life is a story of a few faithful
friendships. He was not befriended for his personal beauty,
but for his inner beauty. His head was too big for his
body, he did not care what sort of clothes he wore, nor did
he have any regard for conventions, fashions or great
personages. He was a real democrat and cared nothing
for titles and the things smaller men respect. Once Beethoven’s
brother called on him and left his card upon which
was written, next his name, “Man of Property.” Beethoven
in return sent his card on which he wrote, “Man
of Brains.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thinking that Napoleon was going to free mankind, he
dedicated the <cite><span lang="it">Eroica</span></cite>, the third symphony, to him. But
when he heard that Napoleon had set himself up as Emperor,
in a violent rage, he trampled on the dedication
page.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day he and Goethe were walking along the street
when the King passed by. Goethe stood aside with uncovered
head but Beethoven refused to alter his path for royalty
and kept on his hat, for he felt on an equality with
every man and probably a little superior. But he lost
his friendship with Goethe because of his many failures to
conform to customs.</p>

<p class='c008'>At twenty-seven Beethoven began to grow deaf. It made
him very morose and unhappy. In 1800 he wrote to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>friend Wegeler, the husband of Eleanore von Bruening,
“My hearing during the last three years has become gradually
worse. I can say with truth that my life is very
wretched. For nearly two years past I have avoided all
society because I find it impossible to say to people ‘I am
deaf.’ In any other profession this might be tolerable
but in mine, such a condition is truly frightful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Beethoven was forceful and noble in spirit, quick tempered,
absent-minded, gruff, and cared little for manners
and customs except to be honest and good. But although
he was absent-minded he never neglected his work or
his obligations to any man, and his compositions show
the greatest care and thought. He worked a piece over
and over before it was finished and not, like Mozart, did it
bubble from him whole and perfect.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was too high-strung and impatient to teach much and
Ferdinand Ries, the son of Franz, and Czerny seem to be
his only well-known pupils. But he taught many amateurs
among the nobility, which probably accounts for many of
his romances. In later years, he withdrew unto himself
and became irritable and suspicious of everybody, both
because of his deafness and the misery his family caused
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet this great man, tortured with suspicions and doubt,
and storming often against his handicap, always stood upright
and straight and never did anything dishonorable
or mean. In fact, he was a very moral man, who lived and
composed according to the dictates of his soul and never
wrote to please or to win favor.</p>

<p class='c008'>He made valuable friends among music lovers and
patrons such as Prince and Princess Lichnowsky, Prince
Lobkowitz, Count Rasomouwsky, Empress Maria Theresa
and others, to whom he dedicated many of his great works.
This he did only as a mark of his friendship rather than for
gain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>He was clumsy and awkward and had bad manners and
a quick temper, and he had a heavy shock of black hair,
that was always in disorder, but the soul of the man shone
out from his eyes and his smile lit up his face. Although
he is said to have been unkempt, he was exceedingly clean,
for when he was composing he would often interrupt his
work to wash.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the <cite>Leonore</cite> overture was being rehearsed, one of
the three bassoon players was missing. Prince Lobkowitz,
a friend of Beethoven, jokingly tried to relieve his mind
by saying, “It doesn’t make any difference, the first and
second bassoon are here, don’t mind the third.” Beethoven
nearly pranced with rage, and reaching the street later,
where the Prince lived, he crossed the square to the
gates of the Palace and stopped to shout at the entrance,
“Donkey of a Lobkowitz!” and then passed on, raving
to himself. But there was a warm, sweet streak in his
nature for his friends loved him dearly, and he was very
good to his nephew Carl, who lied to him and deceived him.
Carl added to Beethoven’s unhappiness, for when he was
lonely and in need of him, Carl never would come to him
unless for money.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beethoven had a high regard for women and loved
Countess Guicciardi, who refused many times to marry
him, but he dedicated <cite>The Moonlight Sonata</cite> and some
of his songs to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>We see his great heart broken by his nephew, we see
his sad letters begging him to come and take pity on his
loneliness, we see him struggle to make money for him;
and all Carl did was to accept all and give nothing. Finally
this ungrateful boy was expelled from college because
he failed in his examinations. This was such a disgrace
that he attempted to commit suicide. As this was also
looked upon as a crime he was given twenty-four hours to
leave Vienna and so enlisted in the army. Nevertheless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Beethoven made Carl his sole heir. Doesn’t this show him
to be a really great person?</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Beethoven the Pianist</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>While at Vienna he met the great pianists and played
far better than any of them. No one played with such
expression, with such power or seemed worthy even to
compete with him. Mozart and others had been charming
players and composers, but Beethoven was powerful
and deep, even most humorous when he wanted to
be.</p>

<p class='c008'>He worked well during these years, and with his usual
extreme care changed and rechanged the themes he found
in his little sketch books into which, from boyhood he had
put down his musical ideas. Those marvelous sketch books!
What an example they are! They show infinite patience
and “an infinite capacity for taking pains” which has been
given by George Eliot as a definition of genius.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Three Periods</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>At his first appearance as a pianist in Vienna he played
his own C major Concerto in 1795. From 1795 to 1803 he
wrote all the works from opus 1 to 50. In these were included
symphonies 1 and 2, the first three piano concertos,
and many sonatas for piano, trios and quartets, a septet
and other less important works.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is the first period of Beethoven’s life. His second
period in which his deafness grew worse and caused him
real physical illness, extended to 1815—in this the trouble
with his nephew and the deceit of his two brothers preyed
on his mind, to such an extent, that he became irascible and
unapproachable. His lodgings were the scene of distressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>upheavals and Beethoven was like a storm-beaten
mountain!</p>

<p class='c008'>For consolation, he turned to his music, and in the storm
and stress he wrote the noble opera <cite>Fidelio</cite>, and the third
symphony, <cite><span lang="it">Eroica</span></cite>, concertos, sonatas and many other
things.</p>

<p class='c008'>Someone once asked him, “Why don’t you write opera?”
He replied, “Give me a libretto noble enough for my
music.” Evidently this is the reason why he wrote only
one opera. We find another example of his patience and
self-criticism, as he wrote four overtures for <cite>Fidelio</cite>. Three
of them are called <cite>Leonore</cite> overtures and one <cite>Fidelio</cite>.
The third <cite>Leonore</cite> seems to be the favorite, and is often
played.</p>

<p class='c008'>By 1822, the beginning of the third period, the great
music maker was stone deaf! Yet he wrote the magnificent
Mass in D and his last symphony, the Ninth, with the
“Hymn of Joy,” two of the great masterpieces of the world,
although he was unable to hear one note of what he had
composed as he could not hear his beloved violin even when
he held it close to his ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Imagine Beethoven—stone deaf, attending a performance
of the Ninth Symphony in a great hall—not knowing
that it had had a triumphal success until one of the
soloists turned him around to see the enthusiastic faces and
the hands clapping and arms waving, for he could hear
not a sound! He who had built such beautiful things for
us to hear, knew them only in his mind!</p>

<p class='c008'>Beethoven was a great lover of nature. He used to
stroll with his head down and his hands behind his back,
clasping his note book in which he jotted down the new
ideas as they came to him. He wrote to a friend, “I wander
about here with music paper among the hills and dales
and valleys and scribble a bit; no man on earth could love
the country as I do.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Beethoven Makes Music Grow</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>If you have ever seen a sculptor modeling in clay you
know that his great problem is to keep it from drying,
because only in the moist state can it be moulded into
shape. In the same way, we have seen in following the
growth of music, that no matter how beautiful a style of
composition is, as soon as it becomes set in form, or in
other words as soon as it hardens, it changes. Let us look
back to the period of the madrigal. You remember that the
early madrigals were of rare beauty but later the composers
became complicated and mechanical in their work and
the beauty and freshness of their compositions were lost.
The people who felt this, reached out for new forms of
expression and we see the opera with its arias and recitatives
as a result. The great innovator Monteverde, broke
this spell of the old polyphonic form, which, like the sculptor’s
clay, had stiffened and dried.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same thing happened after Bach brought the suite
and fugue to their highest. The people again needed something
new, and another form grew out of the suite, the
sonata of Philip Emanuel Bach, Haydn and Mozart.
The works of these men formed the Classic Period which
reached its greatest height with the colossus, Beethoven.
As we told you, he used the form inherited from Haydn
and Mozart, but added much of a peculiar power which
expressed <em>himself</em>. But again the clay hardened! Times
and people changed, poetry, science and philosophy led
the way to more personal and shorter forms of expression.
Up to Bach’s time, music, outside of the folk-song, had not
been used to express personal feeling; the art was too
young and had grown up in the Church which taught the
denial of self-expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same way, the paintings up to the time of the
16th century did not express personal feelings and happenings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>but were only allowed to be of religious subjects, for
the decorating of churches and cathedrals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beethoven, besides being the peak of the classic writers,
pointed the way for the music of personal expression, not
mere graceful expression as was the fashion, which was
called the “Romantic School” because he was big enough
to combine the sonata form of classic mould with the delicacy,
humor, pathos, nobility and singing beauty for which
the people of his day yearned.</p>

<p class='c008'>This led again to the crashing of the large and dried
forms made perfect by Beethoven and we see him as the
bridge which leads to Mendelssohn, Chopin, Schubert and
Schumann and we see them expressing in shorter form
every possible human mood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beethoven was great enough to bring music to maturity
so that it expressed not only forms of life, but life itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>How and what did he do? First, he became master of
the piano and could from childhood sit down and make
marvelous improvisations. He studied all forms of music,
counterpoint, harmony, and orchestration. At first he followed
the old forms, as we see in the first two symphonies.
In the third symphony, the <cite><span lang="it">Eroica</span></cite>, he changed from the
minuet (a relic of the old dance suite) to the scherzo, an
enlarged form of the minuet with more chance for musical
expression,—the minuet grown up. In sonatas like <cite>The
Pathetique</cite>, he used an introduction and often enlarged
the coda or ending, to such an extent that it seems like
an added movement, so rich was he in power in working
over a theme into beautiful musical speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later we see him abandoning set forms and writing the
<cite>Waldstein</cite> Sonata in free and beautiful ways. Even the
earlier sonatas like <cite>The Moonlight</cite> and its sister, Opus
27, No. 2, are written so freely that they are called Fantasy
Sonatas, so full of free, flowing melody has the sonata
become under his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>His work becomes so lofty and so grand, whether in
humorous or in serious vein, that when we compare his
compositions to those of other men, he seems like one of the
loftiest mountain peaks in the world, reaching into the
heavens, yet with its base firmly standing in the midst of
men.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A Composer of Instrumental Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Beethoven was distinctly a composer of instrumental
music, although he wrote the opera <cite>Fidelio</cite>, also the Ninth
Symphony in which he made great innovations in symphonic
form and introduced the Choral.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up to this time, composers in the Classic School had
paid more attention to the voice and to the soloists in the
concertos than to the orchestra. Thus we see men like
Mozart leaving a space toward the end of the movement
in a concerto for the soloist to make up his own closing
salute to his audience before the orchestra ended the
piece. These cadenzas became acrobatic feats in which
the players wrote the most difficult “show-off” music.
Beethoven, with his love for the orchestra and his feeling
that the soloist and the orchestra should make one
complete unit, wrote the cadenza <em>himself</em> and thereby
made the composition one beautiful whole rather than a
sandwich of the composer, soloist and composer again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fancy all this from a man who, when he multiplied
14 × 26 had to add fourteen twenty-sixes in a column!
We saw this column of figures written on a manuscript of
Beethoven’s in an interesting collection, and the story
goes that Beethoven tried to verify a bill that was brought
to him in the midst of a morning of hard work at his
composing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides his symphonies, concertos and sonatas in which
are light moods, dark moods, gay and sad moods, spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>heights and depths, filling hearers with all beauty of emotion,—he
wrote gay little witty things, like the German
Dances, The Fury over the Loss of a Penny (which is
really funny), four overtures, many English, Scotch, Irish,
Welsh and Italian folk-song settings. He also wrote one
oratorio called <cite>The Mount of Olives</cite>, two masses, one of
which is the magnificent <cite><span lang="la">Missa Solemnis</span></cite>, one concerto for
the violin that is the masterpiece of its kind, and the one
grand opera <cite>Fidelio</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus we have told you about the bridge to the “Romantic
Movement” which will follow in the next chapter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beethoven could have said with Robert Browning’s
“Abt Vogler”</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXII<br> <span class='c016'>The Pianoforte Grows Up—The Ancestry of the Pianoforte</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>The Ancestry of the Pianoforte</span></h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c029'>We feel so familiar with the Pianoforte that we call
it piano for short and almost forget that it is dignified
by the longer name. We forget too, that Scarlatti,
Rameau and Bach played not on the piano but on
its ancestors, and that Byrd, Bull and Gibbon did not
write their lovely dance suites for the instrument on which
we play them today.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Pianoforte’s family tree has three distinct branches,—strings,
sounding board and hammers. First we know
the piano is a stringed instrument, although it hides its
chief characteristic, not under a bushel, but behind a casing
of wood.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Where Stringed Instruments Came From</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We have seen the stringed instrument developed from
the bow when primitive man winged his arrow in the hunt,
and heard its twang. Later desiring fuller tone, the sounding
board grew, when early peoples sank bow-like instruments
and reeds into a gourd which increased and reflected
the sound as the metal reflector behind a light intensifies it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Strings to produce sound, must be rubbed, like the bow
drawn across violin strings, plucked as the mandolin or the
harp is plucked, or struck with a hammer as was the
dulcimer.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the ancient times there were two instruments much
alike, the <em>psaltery</em> and the <em>dulcimer</em>, both with a triangular
or rectangular sounding box across which are stretched
strings of wire or gut fastened to tuning pins. The difference
between these two “relatives” is that the <em>psaltery</em>
is plucked with fingers or a plectrum, and the <em>dulcimer</em> is
struck with hammers. So the <em>psaltery</em> is the grandfather of
the virginal, spinet, clavecin, and harpsichord, while the
<em>dulcimer</em> is the remote ancestor of the pianoforte.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first record we find of a <em>dulcimer</em> is a stone picture
near Nineveh, of an Assyrian king in 667 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, celebrating a
triumphal procession. This <em>dulcimer</em>, suspended from the
neck of the player, is being struck with a stick in his right
hand, while his left palm on the string checks the tone.
Here we have the first stringed instrument which was hammered
and muffled, two important elements in the piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Persia the <em>dulcimer</em> was called the <em>santir</em> and is still
used under different names in the Orient and other places.
In Greece and other countries it was called the <em>psalterion</em>,
and in Italy, the <em>dolcimelo</em>. Later, the Germans had a
sort of <em>dulcimer</em> called the <i><span lang="de">Hackbrett</span></i>, probably because it
was “hacked” as the butcher hacks meat! We see the
<em>dulcimer</em> in many shapes according to the fancy of the
people who use it. The word comes from <em>dulce</em>—the
Latin for “sweet” and <em>melos</em>—the Greek for “melody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As people grew wiser and more musical, they padded
their hammers or mallets; this gave the idea for the padded
hammer of the piano for checking the tone as our Ninevehan
did with his left palm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should you ever listen to a gypsy band, you will hear
the <em>dulcimer</em> or <em>cembalo</em>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Keyboard</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The third element in the making of the piano is the
keyboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is evident that the piano keyboard and the organ
keyboard are practically the same. The water organs of
the Greeks and Romans had keyboards, but as the Christian
Church forbade the use of organs as sacrilegious, keyboards
were lost for almost a thousand years.</p>

<p class='c008'>The keyboard seems to have developed from the Greek
<em>monochord</em> used in the Middle Ages to give the pitch in convent
singing. It was tuned with a movable bridge or fret
pushed back and forth under the strings and fingers. First
it was stretched with weights hung at one end. It was a
simple matter to add strings to produce more tones, later
tuning pins were added and finally a keyboard. This was
the whole principle of the <em>clavichord</em>. (We might say that
the <em>monochord</em> and <em>dulcimer</em> are the Adam and Eve of the
pianoforte family.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Clavichord</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the clavichord, each key drove a metal tangent
against a string and was held there as was the bridge of the
monochord. The tone was dependent on the place where
the tangent struck. The string vibrated on one side of
the tangent, but the other part of the string was deadened
by a strip of cloth. The strings were about the same
length and often two or three keys operated the same
string so that it was possible to make a very small instrument.
In the 16th century, it usually had twenty keys;
in the 18th century, four octaves or fifty keys, but of
course there were less than fifty strings! Later, every key
had its own string and these were called <em>bundfrei</em> or unfretted
clavichords, while the others were called <i><span lang="de">gebunden</span></i>
or fretted. The clavichord was usually small enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>carry under the arm, although sometimes it was made
with legs. Should you be in New York you must see the
collection of beautifully ornamented clavichords and
harpsichords at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the
Crosby Brown Collection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bach liked the clavichord better than the harpsichord
and the early pianos that blossomed in his day. Because
of the pressure of the tangent, it was possible to get a delicately
graded tone when the key was pressed, a wavy,
rocking, pulsating effect, which made each player’s performance
very individual, but to us, now, it sounds thin
and metallic. The word “clavichord” comes from <i><span lang="la">clavis</span></i>—a
key, and <em>chord</em>—a string. Clavichords and also virginals
were often played in pairs, no doubt for richer
effect and for volume.</p>

<p class='c008'>Large instruments developed slowly because before the
11th century, wire-drawing (making) was not known, so
all keyed string instruments were strung with gut.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The harpsichord, we like to call the “Jack and Quill”
instrument—for it is played by keys, jacks and quills which
pluck its strings, instead of pressing or hammering. This
is like a keyboarded zither, and is shaped something like
our grand piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each key has a string. Pressing the key pushes a
jack, from whose side projects a small quill or spine which
twangs the string. When the key is released, the quill slips
back into the first position and a damper falls upon the
string. The strings vary in length according to the pitch
for the harpsichord has no tangent to divide off the string
as had the clavichord and monochord. Thus the harpsichord
on account of its long and short strings is not square
like the clavichord but is shaped more like the harp and
the grand piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some one said that the harpsichord tone was “a scratch
with a note at the end of it.” And yet, when we hear
Wanda Landowska play the harpsichord today, it sounds
very beautiful indeed. Smaller varieties are called virginals
and spinets. Perhaps the spinet is named for its inventor
Spinetti, or perhaps the word comes from “spinet”
meaning spine, a thorn or point. The virginal comes
from the word <em>virgo</em>—meaning maiden and was the popular
instrument for the “ladies” of the day. There were
larger harpsichords, too, with two and three keyboards and
very many varieties, both small and large. The clavichord
and the harpsichord were known from the 15th
century and were associated with the organ until the 17th
century, when the Ruckers family developed harpsichord
making into a fine art. The first mention of the harpsichord,
is in the “Rules of the Minnesingers” (1404).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The First Pianofortes</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Early in the 18th century, music ceased to be just pretty
sounds, and musicians wanted instruments on which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>could express deeper feelings and began to look around for
some way to make the harpsichord meet this need.</p>

<p class='c008'>It came about in this way. Pantaleone Hebenstreit, a
fiddler at the Saxon court played a dulcimer which he enlarged
by adding to it a second system of strings. He tuned
it in equal temperament, as Bach had the clavichord, and
used hammers on it which produced very beautiful and
loud tones. Louis XIV saw this, and liking it, called it
the Pantaleone. But, shortly after this, Gottlieb Schroeter
heard it and said, “only through hammers can the harpsichord
become expressive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So in 1721 Schroeter submitted to the King of Saxony
his idea of a harpsichord which could play soft and loud or
in Italian <em>piano</em> and <em>forte</em> (the <em>fortepiano</em> or <em>loud-soft</em> instrument).
But as he had none made he did not get credit for
the invention until after much argument, based on accounts
in his diary. As always, when a thing is needed
someone will invent it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man who actually made the first pianoforte was an
Italian, Bartolomeo Cristofori (1653–1731) of Padua;
and the Frenchman Marius, and the German, Christoph
Gottlieb Schroeter, followed suit. In 1709, Cristofori exhibited
harpsichords (<em>gravicembali</em>) with hammer action
capable of producing <em>piano</em> and <em>forte</em> effects. He advertised
it in the paper as a <i><span lang="it">gravicembali col piano e forte</span></i>. By
1711, the fame of his invention had spread into Germany.
In February, 1716, Marius in France tried to improve the
harpsichord with hammers which he called the <i><span lang="fr">clavecin à
mallets</span></i>, and made two types.</p>

<p class='c008'>Schroeter about this time made the two kinds also. The
piano had little standing, however, until Gottfried Silbermann
took advantage of Bach’s criticism of his pianos and
made a <em>grand</em> type.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next experimenters in pianos were, Frederici of Gera
(died in 1779), who made the <em>square</em>. Spaeth, who made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span><em>grands</em> and George Andreas Stein in Augsburg, who was
trained by Silbermann, invented the Viennese action on
which a light touch was possible and for this reason Mozart
used it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burkhardt Tschudi, a piano maker in London, had a
Scotch assistant, James Broadwood, who became his partner
(1770). Later the firm became John Broadwood and
Sons, which it has remained. It was the first to use the
damper and the soft pedals. For some time they used
Zumpe’s style of square piano but later made their own.
This house used the Cristofori action which made a more
solid and heavier tone than the Viennese action, and was
known as the English action, excellent for large rooms and
concerts. These actions suited the different methods of
piano playing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stein’s daughter Nanette Streicher, a marvelous player
and a cultivated woman, upon inheriting her father’s
piano business moved to Vienna and for forty years was
considered an expert in the piano world. Thayer, in his
life of Beethoven says: “In May, Beethoven, on the advice
of medical men, went to Baden, whither he was followed
by his friend Mrs. Streicher&#160;... who took charge
of his lodgings and his clothes, which appear to have been
in a deplorable state.” Thayer says that Beethoven
always preferred the piano of Stein to any others. Beethoven
wrote to Nanette: “Perhaps you do not know,
though I have not always had one of your pianos, that since
1809 I have invariably preferred yours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So, you see a woman could keep house and be a manufacturer
as well, even in the early 19th century!</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came Sebastien Erard (1752–1831) who made the
first French piano in 1777. Erard invented many new
things for the piano and formed a company in England.
This firm was advertised on the hand bill announcing
Liszt’s concert in Paris when he was twelve years old.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Added to these names is Ignaz Josef Pleyel (1757–1831),
who also made a piano with a very sympathetic tone which
Chopin made famous from 1831. The Pleyel and the Erard
are still the leading pianos of France.</p>

<p class='c008'>For some years the pianoforte went through many
changes. As you are not learning to make a piano, you
will have to take it for granted that there were many
many steps taken from this time on to make the modern
piano. However, the thing that held it back was the all-wood
frame which could not stand the strain of the tightly
drawn strings and it was a long time before the makers
gave up the beautiful wood for the sturdier metal. About
the time of Beethoven, playing the piano became a more
complicated thing than it had been, and a grown up instrument
was needed, so musical instrument makers had
to “step lively” to keep pace with the music. At every
concert, and often in the middle of a piece, the player
would have to stop to retune the instrument on which
he was playing. Therefore, all energy was bent to making
the frame of the piano rigid, the strings more
elastic and the pins firmer, and the metal frame was
used.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these special things were accomplished in later years.
Some of the inventors were John Isaac Hawkins, an Englishman,
who patented the upright pianoforte in 1800 in the
United States, William Allen, a Scotchman, who introduced
metal braces in 1820 and Alpheus Babcock, who patented
the iron frame in a <em>single cast</em>, in Boston, in 1825. It was an
American, Jonas Chickering, of Boston, who invented the
complete iron frame for the concert grand, and at present,
after many years, the instrument which seventy-five years
ago bent under the pull of the strings, can now stand the
strain of thirty tons! Chickering made pianos as early as
1823.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this there was much experimentation in pianos,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>culminating here, in the pianos made by Steinway and Sons
the ancestor of which was the firm of Heinrich Englehard
Steinweg, of Brunswick, Germany, starting as organ
makers. In 1848 Heinrich’s sons went to New York
City and changed their name to Steinway, where Theodore,
the eldest, continued the firm as Steinway and
Sons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, the methods of stringing and tuning a piano
have taken years to develop—all of which we cannot go
into in this book. Now, instead of twenty strings, as we
saw them in the clavichord, we have 243 strings to produce
88 tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>So now we have the harpsichord with hammers “grown
up” into the pianoforte, with its myriad parts, no longer
made by hand, but carefully manufactured by machinery
and the finest of them are American.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Piano Buying Created a Holiday in the 18th Century</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>“When the pianoforte was completed and ready to be
delivered at the house of the impatient purchaser (in
Germany) a festival took place; the maker, was the hero
of the hour, and accompanied the piano followed by his
craftsman and apprentices, if he had any. (In those days
the pianos took months and months to make, for they were
made by hand and the makers received cash in part payment
and the rest was made up in corn, wheat, potatoes,
poultry and firewood!)</p>

<p class='c008'>“The wagon which conveyed the precious burden was
gaily decorated with wreaths and flowers, the horses magnificently
decked out, a band of music headed the procession,
and after the wagon followed the proud maker,
borne on the shoulders of his assistants; musicians, organists,
schoolmasters and dignitaries marching in the rear.
At the place of destination the procession was received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>with greetings of welcome and shouts of joy. The pastor
of the place said a prayer and blessed the new instrument
and its maker. Then the mayor or the burgomaster of
the place delivered an address,—dwelling at great length
upon the importance of the event to the whole community,
and stating, perhaps, that the coming of such a new musical
instrument would raise their place in the eyes of the
surrounding country. Then followed speeches by the
schoolmaster, doctor, druggist, and other dignitaries, and
songs by the <i><span lang="de">Männerchor</span></i> (men’s chorus) of the place.
Amidst the strains of the band, the pianoforte was moved
to its new home. A banquet and a dance closed the happy
occasion.” (From <cite>Reminiscences of Morris Steinert</cite> by
Jane Marlin.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>The Piano and Pneumatics</span>”</h4>

<p class='c018'>It is very difficult to know just when this important
instrument first was invented. It seems to have started
with a mechanical organ and many were the experimenters
among whom was John McTammany, a soldier in the Civil
War who while disabled turned his mind to mechanics and
became one of the great pneumatic (air power) experts.
And so, just as we arrive at the beautiful instrument, the
piano, comes another instrument far more complicated,
whose possibilities are still in its infancy. At present the
automatic piano is operated by bellows and pneumatic
tubes (which look together like a bunch of gray spaghetti)
and through which the air is exhausted and acts in such a
way that the piano hammers fall against the piano strings.
Into these instruments are placed perforated music rolls
which travel over a tracker bar full of holes, each one having
its rubber spaghetti tube. When the bellows work
and the perforation of the roll passes over a perforation
of the tracker bar, the air is released and its exhaustion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>causes the hammer to fall on the strings. This sounds
simple,—but it is not!</p>

<p class='c008'>There are three kinds of automatic players,—one, the
<em>piano player</em>, which is now practically extinct in this country,
a cabinet which moves up to the piano, and with a
series of keys corresponding to the keys on the piano
which, when in action presses down the piano keys and
the tune starts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then we have the <em>player piano</em>. In this, whether it be
an upright or a grand piano, the machinery is inside the
piano itself (instead of being in the outside cabinet), so
that one can hardly tell at first glance whether it is an
automatic instrument or not. The perforated roll is put on
inside the piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these piano player bellows work either by electricity
or by the feet. So in the latter, one cannot help playing
with “sole”!</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>reproducing piano</em> is the third type of player. This
is magical, for it reproduces the player’s performance as he
plays it himself. Therefore we can entice Paderewski,
Bauer, Rachmaninoff and all the other great players into
our own drawing rooms and hear them with their superb
skill. These are usually operated by electricity, yet the
Æolian Company and probably others, have a <em>reproducing
piano</em> which is propelled by the pedals as were the old
ones before the invention of the electric player. Furthermore,
some of the reproducing pianos have a mechanism
with which you yourself can interpret any piece you desire.
This gives the music lover who has been denied the
study of music a chance to enjoy interpreting great
music.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is an impossibility to overestimate the value of the
player piano to the young student, to increase his auditory
repertoire, for the music of the world is his for the turning
of a lever!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Their Contribution to Art</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>For a long time, the mechanical player has been looked
on as a step-child, to be made fun of and scorned. Today,
the great critics and best musicians recognize its value
which is not as a substitute for a piano but as an instrument
in itself. Sir Henry J. Wood of England says: “I
realize the value&#160;... of the pianola&#160;... for a good
many of the people in our audiences&#160;... are acquiring
by its means a closer acquaintance with the great musical
masterpieces.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He says in another place, “It’s a foolish and a shortsighted
policy to despise any means by which we may add
to the sum total of musical appreciation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Edwin Evans, English critic and writer, says:
“The player piano relieves the musician of the technical
difficulties of the keyboard.... It does not relieve him
from the duty of thinking musicianly, on the contrary,&#160;... it makes it a point of honor with him to give&#160;...
fuller employment to his brain and sensibility....
There are dozens of scores nowadays which it is an impossibility
to read at the piano and very trying to read on
paper. Here the player piano is a boon and a blessing for
it unravels every mystery and solves every problem.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides this, it can be played so skilfully by some that
even musicians can be fooled as to whether human or
mechanical fingers are playing. Gustave Kobbé said, in his
<cite>Pianolist</cite>, something like this: “There are only about
five professionals who can play the piano better than an
accomplished pianolist.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To prove its artistic worth further, Percy Grainger,
Alfredo Casella and Igor Stravinsky and other great moderns
are writing music especially for the player piano because
they can use the whole eighty-eight notes with full
orchestral effects, without stopping to think of the meagre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>ten fingers of man! So we see in the future the possibility
of this becoming one of the creative instruments.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Other “Canned” Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Then we have the phonographs and radio. These
cannot be considered instruments in the same way as the
player piano and reproducing piano, but are invaluable
means of musical education and are doing, with the player
piano, a marvelous work in introducing people to the
great music of the world. Of course, it depends upon the
way all these music carriers are used, for if you have poor
music on them, it will mean nothing to you, but if you
hear the “wear evers” on them, you will have a touch of
heaven in your life, forever.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pianists Come to View</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>As an outcome of the work of Bach, Beethoven, and
Mozart, the piano appeared because of the need of a more
powerful instrument than the harpsichord and clavichord.
At this time there were two particular schools of piano
playing,—the Viennese, light and delicate in tone, and the
English school, producing a more solid and more brilliant
tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal pianists of the Viennese school were Johann
Hummel, who, as a boy of seven, was a pupil of Mozart,
Franz Duschek, Mozart and Pleyel. Later Beethoven himself
appeared, the profound pianist in this group, but also
an advocate of Clementi’s methods.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Clementi School is named from Muzio Clementi
(1752–1832), the “Father of the Pianoforte.” He was a
composer of piano pieces, especially of sonatas which are
still of musical value. Who of us has not studied Clementi’s
sonatinas? Besides being a great player, a teacher and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>composer, Clementi published a work called <cite><span lang="la">Gradus ad
Parnassum</span></cite>, piano studies, a form which sprang up because
of the need to develop a technic for the new instruments
when the piano was young.</p>

<p class='c008'>Clementi, at fourteen, went to England, where he lived
all his life and became interested in the making of pianos.
He was associated with the firm of Clementi and Company,
later Collard and Collard, and it is said that he gave the
Broadwoods much advice in the making of their “grand”
piano. So we see Clementi as a founder of piano technic,
and an instrument maker! He lived eighty years, during
the last years of Handel and Scarlatti, and he survived
Beethoven, Schubert and Weber. It is said that Mozart
took a theme from a Clementi sonata for one of his operas.
His pupils were quite famous: John B. Cramer, the composer
of many important piano studies still in use; Johann
L. Dussek, one of the first to invent and write down finger
exercises, and there were many others.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were two schools with Clementi at the head of
one, and Mozart, of the other. With Hummel, a pupil
of Mozart, the Classic School closed, and then Clementi’s
ideas came to the fore in the new Romantic School.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The New Romantic School</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the earliest of these new Romanticists was John
Field, who was born in Ireland, visited London, had quite
a career in Russia and foreshadowed Chopin in his playing.
Then there was Ferdinand Ries, son of Beethoven’s
early friend and teacher, Franz Ries; but the most famous
of this period were Ignaz Moscheles and Frederick
Kalkbrenner, a fluent composer and writer of studies. He
was the first pianist to teach Clementi’s <cite><span lang="la">Gradus ad Parnassum</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ignaz Moscheles (1794–1870) was a Bohemian and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>from about 1815, the most brilliant pianist in Germany,
France, Holland and England. He was Mendelssohn’s
teacher. Chopin wrote three études (studies) on an order
from Moscheles. He is a <em>very</em> important figure in the growing
up of piano music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carl Czerny (1791–1857) was another <em>very</em> important
pianist and one of the few pupils of Beethoven. He was
a follower of Hummel and Clementi and won great fame
as a teacher in Vienna, where he lived. He wrote a great
many pieces, about a thousand in all, making many arrangements
of orchestral works and many piano studies,
which we still use today. Beethoven encouraged him to
make a piano version of his <cite>Fidelio</cite>. Czerny was the teacher
of many able musicians.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frederick Chopin, you will find out later (Chapter 24)
changed piano music from the bravura to a poetic and
deeper style. His touch and tone were so enchanting
that he created a completely new fashion in piano playing
which has not been lost. (See page <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Clara Schumann (1819–1896), the wife of Robert Schumann,
was the leading woman pianist of the day, in fact,
of many days.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the times of Mozart and of Liszt, improvising (before
audiences and at parlor entertainments), was very popular
and a part of a musical education; around 1795, after
the Paris Conservatory was founded, it seemed to die out.
However, organists today often improvise while waiting
for the church service to begin. Dupré, one of the famous
French organists, who has played in the United States,
improvises whole sonatas on given themes.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Chopin, Schumann and Schubert there was a
great love of the short piano piece and as the piano was
being developed more and more, it was natural that
pianists should become numerous. So piano playing was
heard in the concert hall and in the parlor where it was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>to be sure, often light and frivolous and yet quite often,—serious
and delightful. The light and decorated pieces
were usually called <em>salon music</em> and today many are written
which are classed as <em>salon pieces</em>. Cécile Chaminade, as
delightful and clever as her pieces are, is a typical <em>salon</em>
composer, Rubinstein, also, with such pieces as <cite>Melody
in F</cite>, is a writer of salon pieces, and there are countless
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the people who were prominent as pianists and
composers in that day, especially in Poland, where Chopin
was born, were Alois Tausig, a pupil of Thalberg and Josef
Wieniawski, who was the teacher of the “Lion of Pianists,”
Ignace Jan Paderewski.</p>

<p class='c008'>Around Paris gathered many pianists among whom were
Ignace Leybach an organist and composer at Toulouse,
Henry Charles Litolff the famous publisher, Louis Moreau
Gottschalk, American pianist and the author of <cite>The Last
Hope</cite>, and Eugene Ketterer. The following, with many
others, centered around Vienna: Joseph Löw, Theodore
Kullak, Louis Köhler, Gustav Lange and Louis Brassin.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dashing Playing</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A little later, due to the improvements of the piano,
another school grew up called by some, the Bravura
Pianists, because the pieces for these pianists were written
to show off brilliant technic. Most of the people
were flashy pianists, yet there were some very marvelous
performers, for among them, Liszt himself figures
and Thalberg, a Swiss, who was Liszt’s rival for piano
honors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another set of pianists and composers was Henry Herz,
Alexander Dreyschock, Emil Prudent and Adolph Henselt,
a Bavarian, who was an amazingly poetic and beautiful
player.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Practically all these pianists were prominent composers in
their day.</p>

<p class='c008'>About this time we see women coming into great prominence
as professional pianists. The first one to interest
us is  Marie Felicité Denise (Moke) Pleyel, who was Miss
Moke, the beloved of Berlioz and the lady whom he intended
to kill but changed his mind! She was an inspiring
teacher, a pupil of Herz, Moscheles and Kalkbrenner
and was admired by Mendelssohn and Liszt.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Growth of Violin Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The same things seem to have happened to violin playing
and violin music at this time as happened to the piano.
There was always the competition between writing fine,
deep music and showy, spectacular music, which, when
played, would please an audience. But the violin was the
same then as it had been for years,—the only advance it
had made was the perfecting of the bow by François Tourte,
assisted by Giovanni Battista Viotti, Pugnani’s greatest
pupil. We use his bow today. It has about one hundred
white horsehairs, the tension of which is controlled by a
screw at the nut in the finger grip. But the thing that
did affect violinists and violin playing was the fact of
the rise in the 19th century of the orchestra and chamber
music. From the time that madrigals were first accompanied
by instruments, we have heard about <cite>Chamber
Music</cite>, but the string quartet in sonata form as we know
it today, had as its father, Haydn, and Luigi Boccherini
(1743–1805) as a godfather. The link between the Corelli
School of violinists and this school was Viotti who was one
of the first men to write a violin concerto in sonata form.</p>

<p class='c008'>The violinists of this period were also given to bravura
playing as were the pianists. This was a safe thing for
great violinists like Paganini to do, but for the less gifted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>it often developed into, not music at all, but musical calisthenics.
Here is the group which appeared in the early
19th century: Rudolph Kreutzer, to whom Beethoven dedicated
his famous <cite>Kreutzer Sonata</cite>; Andreas Romberg (1767–1821)
who knew Haydn and Beethoven at Vienna and took
Spohr’s place as concert master at Gotha. He wrote music
somewhat in the style of Mozart. Then comes the “Wizard
of the Bow,” Nicolo Paganini, standing alone and belonging
to no school.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was born in Genoa and began to play in public in
1795, when he was thirteen years old. A very pretty story
is told of Paganini and the spider:</p>

<p class='c008'>When Nicolo was a very poor and lonely student, he had
a pet spider that used to listen to him practise. Every
time Nicolo would touch the bow to the strings, out came
Mr. Spider to listen attentively. Now there was a little
girl, the daughter of a shop-keeper near by; she adored
the great, tall, slender youth who spent most of the day
and most of the night playing on his violin. She fell ill
and died, and by a curious coincidence, the spider was
killed. Paganini was so overcome by the loss of his admiring
comrades that he left home at once and wandered
from place to place, playing the guitar when he could not
get work with his violin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later he played all over Europe and had the crowd with
him for his matchless brilliancy in rapid work, his deep
pathos and exceptional beauty of tone. He has probably
never been surpassed in double stopping, chromatics and
his <i><span lang="it">pizzicati</span></i> (plucking the strings). Isn’t it too bad the
greatest violinist in the world lived before the gramophone
was invented, so we have no records of his playing
as we have of Mischa Elman, Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz,
Albert Spalding and Maud Powell!</p>

<p class='c008'>In this period, Ludwig Spohr was of great importance.
He was a friend of Mendelssohn and, curious enough, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>an admirer (one of the early ones) of Wagner. He had
been an intimate of Weber and played with Paganini at
Rome and knew Rossini. His rank as a violinist was
acknowledged. He did not stand for “fire works” but
demanded fine music. He was always a classical musician,
for his early love was Mozart. You will meet him again
in the next chapter. He traveled all over Europe and
met many great men and his autobiography is a rich store
of anecdotes and interesting facts.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this time too, there were many great violinists in
France, Austria, Germany and Italy. We would like to
write a whole volume on the brilliant pianists of the late
19th and 20th centuries such as Paderewski, De Pachman,
Godowsky, Busoni, Rosenthal, Harold Bauer, Gabrilowitsch,
Hofmann, Rachmaninov, Teresa Carreño, Myra
Hess, Guiomar Novaes, Katherine Bacon, John Powell,
Percy Grainger, Levitski and innumerable others!</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIII<br> <span class='c016'>Opera Makers of France, Germany and Italy—1741 to Wagner</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>As with all things that are over-popular and over-used,
the opera in the 18th century became trifling and
empty, except for the work of some few geniuses.</p>

<p class='c008'>The music of the ancient Egyptians and Chinese advanced
very little, on account of fast and firm laws,
and opera remained the same for a long time, because of
the strict rules. For there were laws governing the kind
of arias, the number of men’s parts and women’s parts,
when and where ballets and choruses should come in, the
number of acts and many another clogging rule. But,
worst of all, the people in the audiences knew the rules so
well that they made a fuss when any composer dared to
depart from them. Such was the case when Gluck came
on the scene, and when he left it, with all the changes he
made, other rules became just as binding!</p>

<p class='c008'>You saw the effort of Gluck to reform opera in order to
arrive at truth and sincerity; you saw how Mozart dignified
the forms that were being used by enriching them, by
his sparkling humor, by his new musical devices and limitless
outpourings of melody. Beethoven, too, made his one
masterpiece, <cite>Fidelio</cite>, stand for sincerity rather than triviality,
and now von Weber we see adding to opera the
story of peasant life in Germany, combined with mystery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>and beauty. Yet, with all these forerunners of a newer
opera, many composers had to work very hard and much
time had to pass by until we reach the great change under
Wagner’s genius.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Von Weber Writes Fairy Tale Opera</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Because Carl Maria von Weber (1786–1826) had so great
an influence on opera writers, we will start with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Weber was the founder of romantic German opera,—the
opera that dealt with people and their feelings and
the folk song of the German nation. He was the first to
combine the story of everyday life with the charm of imagination.
Being of a long line of barons and also a great
pianist, he raised the position of musicians to a high level
in society, so that after him, pianists and violinists were
looked upon as artists and not as artisans.</p>

<p class='c008'>He seemed to understand the life of his time, and suited
his work to his surroundings so beautifully, that it immediately
led away from the trivialities into which Italian
opera had drifted, into something more worth while. He
was a true romantic, as he put into his operas warmth of
feeling, elegance and delightful melody. He had a lovely
sense of what was dramatic or theatric, and he knew the
orchestral instruments as well as he knew the piano, for
which he wrote skilfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was born at Eutin, near Lübeck, where Bach had
lived, and showed great musical gifts when he was a little
boy. And although he was delicate, his father dearly
wanted him to be a second Mozart. Michael Haydn,
brother of Papa Haydn taught him and Weber showed
great ability at the piano and could sit down and improvise
and read music at sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was taught by Abbé Vogler in Vienna, who first
introduced him to folk music, which he used with such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>pleasing skill later. (By the way, Abbé Vogler, a famous
organist and teacher, was the Abt Vogler of Robert Browning’s
poem.) Weber became conductor of the orchestra
at Breslau at 18. But, being a delicate boy, he could
not stand many of the things he did and he broke down
in health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later he was unfortunate enough to become secretary to
Duke Ludwig of Württemberg at Stuttgart who was not a
fit companion for a young man. Weber mixed in the gay
life of the Duke and his friends, fell into bad habits,
and drifted into money difficulties. Strange to say, during
this time he read much and even wrote some music
encouraged by Danzi, his friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, he got into a scrape trying to help his father
out of a financial difficulty, angered the King and was banished
in 1810; and though cleared of his guilt, he remained
in exile for some time. Then deciding to turn over a new
leaf, with a mind teeming with ideas, he settled down to
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>He soon became known for his compositions and was
made Musical Director at the Prague Theatre, where he
won popular favor by writing national songs. He undertook
to organize a Dresden troupe, after having done a similar
work in Prague, but he was annoyed by bad health
and the jealousies of his rivals. Nevertheless, here he produced
<cite><span lang="de">Der Freischütz</span></cite>, <cite>Enchanted Huntsman</cite>, which Berlin
received in 1821 with wild enthusiasm, while <cite>Euryanthe</cite>,
given almost at the same time, was not, in Vienna, very successful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Weber’s operas, as the beginning of German romantic
opera, are on the direct road to Wagner’s. Wagner inherited
from Gluck and Weber, and Gluck inherited directly
from the German <cite>Singspiel</cite> (sing-play) of the 18th century,
which was a play composed of dances and songs not unlike
the English masque and the French ballet and vaudeville.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>It came before opera in Germany, yet made the basis for a
German school, for it used German song and German subjects.
Mozart, too, was one of Weber’s musical fathers,
especially in his <cite>Magic Flute</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>We see Weber, now, as we saw Mozart, combining the
supernatural with national or German melody, and using
both imagination and realistic effects. His <cite>Oberon</cite> is full of
fairy atmosphere and <cite><span lang="de">Der Freischütz</span></cite> is often uncanny and
awesome. He keeps the spoken dialogue of the old <cite>Singspiel</cite>
and in <cite><span lang="de">Der Freischütz</span></cite> deals for the first time with peasant
life. His orchestration is lovely and his skill with it
was so great that he is still looked upon as one of the important
men in the development of the orchestra. He
paints the individual characters beautifully by giving each
one suitable music to sing.</p>

<p class='c008'>He reached dramatic heights by his contrasts between
mellow quietness and brilliant effects. He made use of
all the resources on his instruments, their defects as well
as their good points. No one had ever before written more
weird music than in the scene of the Wolf’s Glen, in <cite><span lang="de">Der
Freischütz</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>His piano music, including many fine sonatas, was rich
with new and brilliant effects and his <cite>Concertstück</cite> (Concert-piece)
was the father of the symphonic poems which were
later written by Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz, Tchaikovsky,
and Richard Strauss. Thus did Weber give much to
music’s growth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Louis Spohr (1784–1854) who was later a kind friend
to Wagner, wrote ten operas which belong, too, in the
Romantic School of Weber. He, however, was best known
for his violin concertos, written in the classic style of Haydn
and Mozart. He wrote these because he lived in the time
of the great piano and violin virtuosi (brilliant performers)
in Vienna. His work is tiresome to us because of his
many mannerisms.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="fr">Grétry and Opéra Comique</span></span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Now we will go back a little and take up the French
School with Grétry, the first man of importance in France
after Rameau, and the founder of the comedy opera (<i><span lang="fr">opéra
comique</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>André Ernest Modeste Grétry (1741–1813), was born in
Liège. He excelled in the <i><span lang="it">opera buffa</span></i> imported from Italy,
which, due to the great sense of humor of the French,
immediately became popular. In spite of their vulgarity
there was much in these comedy operas that was delightful
and they were on subjects which interested the people.
Grétry was very skilful and successful in this kind of opera
of which he wrote fifty in addition to much church music,
six symphonies and many instrumental pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i>, a more refined form of this <em>opera
buffa</em>, had a long vogue in France. It became more serious,
too, getting very close to grand opera, except that it
had spoken words. <cite><span lang="fr">Opéra comique</span></cite> always kept its naturalness,
was simple, straightforward in story and informal in
action. Another important difference from grand opera
was that it could be easily given in small theatres, for it
needed no spectacular scenes. This of course made <i><span lang="fr">opéra
comique</span></i> popular, for composers liked to write it, as they had
a better chance to have their works performed than if they
had written grand opera with costly scenes. This form has
been the inspiration of many of the French composers of
the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite><span lang="fr">Opéra comique</span></cite> is first found in Paris at the time of the
War of the Buffoons in 1752 the year that Pergolesi’s little
opera <cite><span lang="it">La Serva Padrona</span></cite>, took Paris by storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, Paris had become the great meeting place for
composers, and we find Italians and Germans going there
to give operas, combining the ideas of Rameau, Lully and
Gluck, with their own national styles. They often displaced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>the French musicians and Paris was a center of
jealousies and heart aches in the midst of its brilliancy.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="it">Cherubini—Musical Czar of Paris</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The first of these foreigners to invade France was Luigi
Cherubini (1760–1842), a Florentine, who became the
musical czar of Paris. He was educated in Italy and in
the beginning wrote Italian opera in the popular style.
He went to London on invitation and was made composer
to the King. In 1788 we see him in Paris giving his
opera <cite>Demophon</cite>. In this, instead of being trivial in the
waning Italian style, he became “grand” and pompous!
Nearly every one that followed, copied him. Beethoven
himself thought him to be the greatest living composer,
because of his <cite>Lodoiska</cite> (1791) and <cite>The Water Carrier</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cherubini started as a composer of church music and
wrote most of his operas from 1780 to 1800. He returned
to church music later in life and wrote his great Credo for
eight voices. He composed in all forms required of the
Roman Catholic service and one of the noblest, sacred
writings is his Requiem in C.</p>

<p class='c008'>But his opera writing influenced his church music and
made him and many who followed him, compose such
spectacular church music that the solemn polyphony of
the 17th century was well-nigh lost. About twenty years
ago, the Pope decided that this style of writing was not
suitable for the church and so ordained it, that only Gregorian
Chant should be sung in the Roman Catholic
Church. History repeats itself and Church music, as in
the time of St. Gregory and of Palestrina, had to have
another “house-cleaning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cherubini’s orchestration was broad and fine and his
overtures were classic models. He seemed to have followed
Mozart’s style rather than Gluck’s and joined the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>classic style with the modern. He had vigor, and was
free from mannerisms, and was looked upon as a great man.
As the head of the Paris Conservatory he was able to
befriend many a struggling composer. He died after a
long useful life, at 82.</p>

<p class='c008'>His <cite><span lang="fr">Medée</span></cite> and <cite>The Water Carrier</cite> (<cite><span lang="fr">Les deux journées</span></cite>)
mark the greatest accomplishment in his life—both are
tragic yet are <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i> because they contain spoken
dialogue. Remember this instance of tragic <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i>
and it will explain how it differs from what we call comic
opera.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Followers of Gluck</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Following the time of Gluck in Paris there was a group
of composers who were so much influenced by him that
they are looked upon as his disciples. One of these was his
own pupil, Antonio Salieri (1750–1825), who in turn taught
Beethoven, Schubert and others.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the links between the 18th and 19th centuries
was Etienne Nicholas Méhul (1763–1817), a Frenchman,
who worked with Gluck. He dared to take his themes from
life and wrote <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i> with a serious aim. Even
though he lived in the turbulence of the French Revolution,
he wrote thirty operas, among which the greatest is
<cite>Joseph</cite>. He was made inspector at the new Conservatory
and also an Academician, and was one of the most loved
composers of his day. He was often noble in musical
expression and handled his chorus and orchestra with
skill. He wrote little of anything but opera, but pointed
the way for others, especially in the use of local color and
national feeling.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next follower of Gluck, Gasparo Spontini (1774–1851),
born in Italy, of peasant stock, was one of the first
to write historic opera, which was further developed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Meyerbeer and others. Technically, this is known as
French Grand Opera, which was being developed at the
same time as <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i>. It appealed to hearts and
imagination, for the people loved the great scenes and
patriotism portrayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spontini first went to Paris in 1803 and the people did
not like his work. But he persisted, studied Gluck and
Mozart as hard as he could, and produced <cite>Milton</cite>, which
showed the public that his work had some beauty. After
this he wrote <cite><span lang="it">La Vestale</span></cite>, a noble work which swept him
into favor and he won a prize offered by Napoleon and
judged by Méhul, Gossec (a composer), and Grétry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Weber, however, while Spontini was absent came to Paris
with <cite><span lang="de">Der Freischütz</span></cite>, and took his place in the hearts of
the people. Cast down by losing his popularity, Spontini
returned to Italy. His musical ability was not equal to
his great plots, yet, as the first writer of historic opera
he deserves a place in the growing up of musical drama.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grétry made French <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i> out of <i><span lang="fr">opéra bouffe</span></i>.
Among the well known writers of <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i> in France
were François Adrienne Boieldieu, Daniel François Esprit
Auber, Louis Joseph Ferdinand Hérold, Jacques François
Halévy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boieldieu (1775–1834) was born in Rouen and became,
in 1800, professor of piano at the Paris Conservatory. He
wrote piano pieces and operas, and is best known for his
<cite><span lang="fr">La Dame Blanche</span></cite> (“The White Lady”) which is still heard
in Paris. His operas combine sweet melody, amusing
rhythm with not a little dramatic style. He shows in
his works a real understanding of how characters and action
should be handled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Auber (1782–1871) called “The Prince of Opéra Comique,”
was born in Paris, and later he became the Director
of the Conservatory and Imperial Chapel Master to Napoleon
III. His best known operas are <cite><span lang="it">Fra Diavolo</span></cite>, <cite>The Black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Domino</cite>, <cite>Masaniello</cite>, or <cite><span lang="fr">La Muette de Portici</span></cite> (<cite>The Dumb Girl
of Portici</cite>). He had great popularity during his day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hérold (1791–1833) was not as accomplished as either
Auber or Boieldieu. He was the son of a piano teacher and
studied at the Conservatory under Méhul. In 1812 he won
the <i><span lang="fr">Prix de Rome</span></i> (the prize given by the Conservatory for
composition, which permitted the student to go to Rome
to perfect himself in his art, and to increase his culture, at
the expense of the Government.) His best operas are <cite><span lang="it">Zampa</span></cite>
and <cite><span lang="fr">Le Pré aux Clercs</span></cite>. He was particularly good in orchestration,
and his works are still heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last one in this group is Jacques François Halévy
(1799–1862), who is chiefly famous for <cite><span lang="fr">La Juive</span></cite> (<cite>The Jewess</cite>),
a type of historic opera, even though he wrote many
in the style of <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i>. It is still given today, and it
was while singing in this opera, at the Metropolitan Opera
House that Caruso was stricken with his fatal illness and
Martinelli, a few years later was taken ill, and so it is
looked upon with superstition by some of the singers.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Meyerbeer Composes Very Grand “Grand Opera”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Next, comes Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791–1864), and he
followed the historic style that Spontini had begun. He,
though a German, captured the French audiences and is
famous chiefly for writing grand scenes, rather than for
noble music in grand opera. His name was Jacob Liebmann
Beer, but he changed it to Meyerbeer. He was the
son of a Jewish banker and had no struggle for money as
did so many of the composers. He began as a pianist and
was also a pupil of Abbé Vogler. He was unsuccessful in
Germany, so went to Italy. After an invitation to hear his
opera <cite><span lang="it">Il Crociato</span></cite> (<cite>The Crusader</cite>) performed in Paris, he
took up his residence there.</p>

<p class='c008'>His style was a queer mixture of German counterpoint,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Italian melody and French rhythm, and after blotting up
all the popular fashions of the day, he gave his <cite>Robert le
Diable</cite> (<cite>Robert the Devil</cite>), <cite>The Huguenots</cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">Le Prophète</span></cite>
(<cite>The Prophet</cite>) with different degrees of success in Paris.
Eugène Scribe was chief librettist in this period. Later
Meyerbeer’s operas were given in Berlin, with Jenny Lind
in the title rôles and he became very famous. <cite>Dinorah</cite>
and <cite><span lang="fr">L’Africaine</span></cite> (<cite>The African Maid</cite>) were very popular
and are still in the repertory of opera companies. But
his style seems insincere and showy according to those
who expect more of opera than grand effects, glitter and
elaborate scenery. <cite>The Huguenots</cite> was probably his finest
piece of work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among other composers in Germany whose names you
may come upon in other places are: Heinrich Marschner
(1795–1861), Conradin Kreutzer, Lortzing (1801–1851),
von Flotow (1812–1883), composer of <cite><span lang="it">Stradella</span></cite> and <cite>Martha</cite>,
and Otto Nicolai (1810–1849) who wrote the delightful
bit of fluff, <cite>The Merry Wives of Windsor</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later we see the old <cite>Singspiel</cite> take the form of Comic
Opera (not <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i>) with such Germans as Carl Millocker
and von Suppé and Victor Nessler in his <cite>Trumpeter
of Sakkingen</cite> and <cite>The Pied Piper of Hamelin</cite>, and Johann
Strauss, the great Viennese Waltz King, whose “Blue
Danube” and other waltzes are so familiar. (Vienna was
as famous for the waltz as America is for jazz.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Offenbach’s Tales of Hoffmann</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Another German who went to Paris was Jacques Offenbach
(1819–1880) from Cologne, who became more of a
Parisian than the Parisians. He was quite a fop and Wagner
once called him “the musical Clown” for he was often
seen wearing a yellow waist-coat and trousers, sky blue
coat, grey gloves, a green hat and he carried a red sun shade.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>How like an electric sign he must have looked! But withal,
he was so popular in Vienna that when Wagner approached
the Opera House about his <cite><span lang="de">Meistersinger</span></cite> he was told that
they were too busy producing Offenbach’s operas to consider
his. He was the best box-office attraction of his
time, and the managers could not get enough of his works.
Offenbach was important because he founded a new kind
of light opera, or the operetta, which is light in story,
charming and winsome. His chief operas are <cite>The Grand
Duchess of Gerolstein</cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">La Belle Hélène</span></cite> and his masterpiece
<cite>The Tales of Hoffmann</cite> of which you probably know the
often-played Barcarolle. He felt that it was his finest
work and was very eager to be present at its first performance
at the Opéra Comique in Paris, but before he
had finished orchestrating it, he died. When it was
given, the following year, it was praised as the work of
a genius.</p>

<p class='c008'>His followers were Planquette, with <cite>Chimes of Normandy</cite>,
Lecocq and his <cite><span lang="fr">La Fille de Mme. Angot</span></cite>, and <cite>Giroflé-Girofla</cite>,
and Franz von Suppé with <cite>Fatinitza</cite>, <cite>Boccaccio</cite> and the <cite>Poet
and Peasant</cite> overture, played at all movie-houses!</p>

<p class='c008'>In Vienna Johann Strauss with his waltzes, and the
most perfect comic opera of its kind, <cite><span lang="de">Die Fledermaus</span></cite> (<cite>The
Bat</cite>) still sparkling and delightful, <cite>Zigeuner-Baron</cite> (<cite>Gypsy-Baron</cite>),
all owe their start in life to Offenbach’s genius. We
too, in America, have had the gifted Victor Herbert with
his <cite><span lang="fr">Mlle. Modiste</span></cite>, <cite>The Serenade</cite>, <cite>The Red Mill</cite> and many
other lovely operettas and Reginald De Koven with <cite>Robin
Hood</cite>. The inimitable pair in England, Sir Arthur Sullivan
and his librettist W. S. Gilbert, wrote comic operas
that have become classics. (See page <a href='#Page_341'>341</a>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>So, the foppish Offenbach sowed fruitful seed, and the
crop that followed him have given high pleasure and delightful
times to many, and probably will, for years to
come.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>An Italian Trio—Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We have dipped into Germany and France so now we
must see what was going on in Italy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few Italians realized that great musical advances were
being made in other countries and kept on doing the same
old things. But one or two became famous because they
left Italy to mingle with the other composers and audiences
of Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the best known of these was Giacchino Rossini
(1792–1868), who became director of the <cite>Theatre Italien</cite>,
in Paris, after visits to Vienna and London. His masterpiece
was <cite>William Tell</cite>, based on the Schiller poem dealing
with the hero of Swiss history. Among other things,
and very delightful, was his <cite>Barber of Seville</cite>, which was
modelled after the <cite>Marriage of Figaro</cite>, the conversational
opera invented by Mozart, whose influence can also be
seen in his <cite>Semiramide</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rossini’s church music, such as the well known <cite><span lang="la">Stabat
Mater</span></cite> is also florid but full of beautiful living melody. This
and the <cite>Solemn Mass</cite> are often given today. He was a
brilliant composer, an innovator and did much to abolish
the foolish cadenza in opera. His work is very ornate
but shows skill in concerted pieces,—choruses and the endings
or finales of the acts.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the best known followers of Rossini in Italy was
Gaetano Donizetti (1797–1848) with his <cite>Daughter of the
Regiment</cite>, <cite>Lucrezia Borgia</cite> and <cite>Lucia di Lammermoor</cite> from
Sir Walter Scott’s story, <cite>The Bride of Lammermoor</cite>. He
wrote showy brilliant things like the sextet and the mad
scene from <cite>Lucia</cite> and by his very skill in these musical
fireworks, kept back opera founded on truth and sincerity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vincenzo Bellini (1801–1835), unlike Donizetti, wrote
only in the grand style and not in the <i><span lang="fr">comique</span></i>. His best
known works are <cite>Norma</cite>, <cite>I Puritani</cite> (<cite>The Puritan</cite>) and <cite>La
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>Sonnambula</cite> (<cite>The Sleep Walker</cite>). Though he was a better
writer than Donizetti, Bellini is heard far less often today.
He also used too many frilly, frothy effects and held back
the advance of opera.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Opera Singers of the Period</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>As there cannot be successful opera without opera singers,
here are the names of a few who have gone down to history:
Angelica Catalani, Giudittza Pasta, Henriette Sontag,
Wilhelmine Schroeder-Devrient, Maria Garcia Malibran,
Pauline Viardot Garcia, Henriette Nissen, Giulia
Grisi, Jenny Lind, Caroline Carvalho, Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa,
Zelia Trebelli, Pauline Lucca, and Adelina Patti,
and Manuel Garcia, John Braham, Domenico Ronconi,
Nicholas Levasseur, Joseph Tichatschek, Guiseppe Mario,
Enrico Tamberlick, Theodor Wachtel, Charles Santley and
John Sims Reeves.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>English Opera-Ballad</span><br> <span class='sc'>18th Century</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Fifteen years after the period in which Purcell glorified
English music, Handel went to England and gathered about
him composers who wrote along the lines which he popularized.
In addition to this, ballad-operas, part songs,
“catches” (separate songs or ballads) were very popular.
In London, there were comic plays made of strings of
songs such as Gay’s <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite> which were sisters to
<i><span lang="it">opera buffa</span></i> in Italy, <i><span lang="fr">opéra bouffe</span></i> in France, and the <cite>Singspiel</cite>
in Germany.</p>

<p class='c008'>Forty-five of these ballad-operas were produced in 15
years. The arrangers of these amusing song-plays included
the names of Dr. Pepusch, a German who lived in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>London; Henry Carey (1692–1743), famous as the composer
of <cite>Sally in our Alley</cite>, <cite>God Save the King</cite> (our <cite>America</cite>);
and Thomas Arne (1710–1778) who wrote many masques,
numerous ballad-operas, and set many of the Shakespeare
lyrics and wrote many glees and ballads. Some of these
part songs were very beautiful and somewhat like the
madrigals of earlier days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the church composers in their lighter moods
wrote some of these ballad-operas, among them: Samuel
Arnold, with his <cite>Maid of the Mill</cite>, a <i><span lang="it">pasticcio</span></i>, “Notable,”
says Waldo Selden Pratt, “as the first native music drama,
since Purcell”; William Jackson; Thomas Atwood and
Charles Dibden who was so successful with his <cite>Shepherd’s
Artifice</cite> that he wrote seventy others, and thirty musical
monologues, among which were <cite>Sea Songs</cite>. Some other well
known men were Michael Arne, son of Dr. Thomas Arne
with his <cite>Fairy Tale</cite>, <cite>Almena</cite> and <cite>Cymon</cite> from Garrick’s
play of the same name; James Hook with some two thousand
songs and twenty-five plays; William Shield, the viola
player and song writer; Stephen Storace, clever violinist
and the author of <cite>The Haunted Tower</cite> and <cite>Pirates</cite>, and his
sister Ann Storace, a singer. At this time there were two
clubs, one called the “Catch Club” and another the “Glee
Club,” and one also called “Madrigal Society,” and before
1800 we have a list of glee writers including the two Samuel
Webbs, Sr. and Jr., Benjamin Cook and his son Robert,
John Wall Callcott, a pupil of Haydn, who won many
medals from the “Catch Club.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From now on, England was influenced by foreign composers,
especially Mendelssohn, Weber and Gounod, and
made ballad operas and operettas freely adapted from
continental works, besides glees and songs and music for
the Church of England services. The interest in music
was great and some of the church music and glees at the
time were excellent. In this period, the Birmingham Festivals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>were started, Horsley founded the <i><span lang="la">Concentores Sodales</span></i>
(1748–1847), a group formed along the lines of the earlier
Catch and Glee Clubs. The Philharmonic Society also was
formed (1813) and among its great leaders were Cherubini
in 1815, Spohr 1820 and 1843 and Weber 1826 and Mendelssohn
many times after 1829. Through the effort of
the Earl of Westmoreland, the Royal Academy of Music
was organized in 1822. Among the composers of this
period were Samuel Wesley (1776–1837). He was a Bach
enthusiast and wrote much church music and other classic
forms; William Crotch (1775–1847), George Stark, an
intimate of Weber and Mendelssohn, who edited <cite>Gibbon’s
Madrigals</cite>; William Horsley, who edited <cite>Callcott’s Glees</cite>
and wrote glees himself, symphonies and songs and handbooks.
There were many others in this period but too
numerous to mention here.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the next period England’s composers free themselves
from the Mendelssohn School and begin to branch out.
Do not think that Mendelssohn was not good for them.
He gave much that England needed, and also brought
English composers in contact with European music. But
they liked church music and the ballad opera and the charming
part songs, rather than the heavier operas of Europe.
Among writers of cathedral music, are Sir George A.
MacFarren, John Bacchus Dykes, whose name appears in
our hymn books, Joseph Barnby, Samuel Wesley mentioned
above, and Henry Smart. In 1816, Sir William Sterndale
Bennett was born, he was a choir boy and entered the
Royal Academy of Music in 1835. The House of Broadwood
(English piano makers) sent him to Leipsic to study
and he came under the influence of Mendelssohn and Schumann.
He was the director of the Royal Academy of
Music, a fine pianist and wrote many compositions, among
which his Cantata <cite>A Woman of Samaria</cite> is not as dry as
the usual sacred works of this period.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>Another great writer of this time was Sir John Stainer
(1840–1901). Some of his things are given today in our
churches and are very beautiful and impressive. He is
the author of valuable text-books.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Light Opera</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>At this time, some writers of a sort of belated ballad
opera appeared in the persons of:</p>

<p class='c008'>Michael William Balfe who wrote thirty operas among
which is <cite>The Bohemian Girl</cite>, still played and greatly admired;
William Vincent Wallace, like Balfe an Irishman,
who is famous for his <cite>Maritana</cite>; and then of course, Sir
Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842–1900), who probably needs
very little introduction to any American or any Englishman
for he wrote <cite>The Mikado</cite>, <cite>Pirates of Penzance</cite>, <cite>Iolanthe</cite>,
the only fairy opera without a mortal in it, <cite>Pinafore</cite>,
<cite>Patience</cite>, <cite>Princess Ida</cite>, <cite>Trial by Jury</cite>, <cite>Ruddigore</cite> and many
others, including the first light opera, <cite>Cox and Box</cite>, which
was the first time that he and W. S. Gilbert, as librettist,
worked together. W. S. Gilbert was the author of the
inimitable and amusing <cite>Bab Ballads</cite>. If you haven’t read
them you have a treat in store for you! They wrote together
in a fresh, mock-heroic, humorous vein, and it seems
as if they were made for each other, so delightfully did they
play into each other’s hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sullivan was the son of a clarinet player and teacher.
He also began, as did so many British Islanders, as a choir
boy and entered the Royal Academy of Music on a Mendelssohn
Scholarship. Later he went to the Leipsic Conservatory
and wrote some music to Shakespeare’s <cite>Tempest</cite>,
which established his fame in England. Besides his
operas he wrote much incidental music, some anthems and
cantatas, among these <cite>The Golden Legend</cite> and <cite>The Prodigal
Son</cite> are the best. He wanted very much to write grand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>opera, but he never seemed to work well in this vein and
his <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> did him little good.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so, we leave opera until the wand of the Wizard
Wagner changes the whole path of music.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIV<br> <span class='c016'>The Poet Music Writers—Romantic School</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>Schubert—Mendelssohn—Schumann—Chopin</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>You have seen how Romantic Music began, and why
Beethoven is often the first name mentioned when
Romanticism is talked about, for he was the colossal guidepost
pointing the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was as far from the classical forms of Bach, as from
later writers who have “jumped over the musical traces”
altogether. All were, and still are, trying to free themselves
from conventions, and to express their feelings
satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is natural to begin the Romantic school with Schubert,
the first figure of great importance. But there was one
John Field (1782–1837) from totally different surroundings
who is still remembered for his fine piano nocturnes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Impressed with the quiet and solemnity of the night, he
knew how to put it into beautiful melody. He was born
in a little out-of-the-way street in Dublin, not far from St.
Patrick’s Cathedral, and near the birthplace of that romantic
poet, Tom Moore. His father and his grandfather,
both musicians, forced the infant prodigy, and at ten, he
played, publicly, a concerto composed by his father.</p>

<p class='c008'>At twelve, the boy was apprenticed, or “hired out,”
as pupil and salesman to Clementi, the composer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>piano manufacturer in London. He showed off the pianos
so well to the customers, that Clementi soon realized he
had made a good bargain. The boy played in London as
the “ten-year-old pupil of Clementi,” on whom he no
doubt tried out his <cite><span lang="la">Gradus ad Parnassum</span></cite>. (Page <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Five years later he played his own “Concerto for the
grand <em>fortepiano</em>, composed for the occasion.” Clementi
was shrewd, and started a branch of his piano business in
St. Petersburg, taking Field with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the ear-marks of Romantic music is the title of
the piano piece or song. Until the romantic period music
was designated usually by the number of the work or by
its form such as <em>gavotte</em>, <em>minuet</em>, <i><span lang="it">rondo</span></i>, <em>sonata</em>, etc., but the
Romantics wrote what they felt, and with the exception of
Chopin, gave descriptive names to their pieces. In 1817
John Field wrote a concerto named <cite><span lang="fr">L’incendie par l’orage</span></cite>
(<cite>The Fire from the Storm</cite>), a musical picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>His influence was more important than his music. We
see his hand in the playing and composing of the poet-pianist,
Frederick Chopin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although Weber appeared in a different musical field
he, too, had a strong influence. He was four years younger
than Field but had greater opportunities and was one of
the first of the Romantic School.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charles Mayer (1799–1862) was a direct follower and
pupil of Field. His <i><span lang="fr">études</span></i> (studies) ranked with those of
Henselt, who wrote the delightful <cite>If I Were a Bird</cite>, and
he had an influence upon Chopin, too.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Schubert—Maker of Songs</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>And now we come to Franz Peter Schubert (1797–1828),
born in Vienna of a schoolmaster father, and a mother,
who, like Beethoven’s, was a cook.</p>

<p class='c008'>The musical comedy, <cite>Blossom Time</cite>, was built upon some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>of Schubert’s most beautiful melodies and episodes from
his life. We must never trust too far stories told this way,
which often contain unreliable details, however this charming
operetta gives an interesting glimpse of Schubert’s
devotion to composition. It is true that he wrote wherever
he was, covering his cuffs as well as the menus and programs
in the taverns with the endless flow of themes which
eventually became world-famous songs. Schubert was not
a mere writer of songs; he created the form known as
<i><span lang="de">Lieder</span></i> and through all his works, torrents of melody seemed
to spring from him eternally.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was the thirteenth of nineteen children, five of which
were of a second marriage, and there was no wealth or luxury
for Franz, so his father worked hard to pay for his
music lessons.</p>

<p class='c008'>His teacher said that no matter what he tried to teach
him in violin, piano, singing, the organ or thorough-bass,
Franz knew it already, for he learned everything almost
at a glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was first soprano in the church choir of Lichtenthal
and the beauty of his voice attracted much attention.
He also played the violin in the services, and stole little
stray minutes to write songs or pieces for strings and
piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he was sent to the school for Imperial choristers the
boys laughed at his coarse, grey clothing, the big “Harold
Lloyd spectacles,” and his retiring, bashful manners. They
soon changed when they discovered the astonishing things
he could do. His home-spun clothes were exchanged for
the uniform trimmed with gold lace worn by the Imperial
choristers, who formed an orchestra to practise daily music
by Haydn, Mozart, Cherubini and Beethoven. Among
them was Spaun and when he won his confidence, Franz
told him that he had written many pieces and he would
write more, but could not afford to buy the music paper.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>His new friend made it possible for Schubert to have paper
and many other luxuries, in which Spaun did something
to benefit the world,—a little kindness which brought
great results.</p>

<p class='c008'>The extreme ease with which Schubert absorbed all learning
made him neglect the study of counterpoint, because
after all he could not give all his time to music, for he was
a schoolteacher and had to work hard to get along. His
heart was not in his work, for while hearing the pupils
recite he wrote themes on every scrap of paper he could
find.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote with lightning rapidity. The early songs met
with immediate favor which encouraged him to write music
in larger form. He was of the people and wrote from the
heart, and to the heart. He hoped for the same success
with his symphonies and chamber music, but the symphonies
never reached the perfection of his songs, and his
disappointment was keen when the critics did not rate
them as highly.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, the steady flow of melody, the torrent of
themes, never ended and his chamber music is like a song
with lovely play of instruments. Who can forget the
haunting beauty of the <cite>Unfinished Symphony</cite>? This was
left unfinished, indeed, not by Schubert’s death as many
suppose, but the composer felt that he had arrived at a
summit of beauty in the second movement, and he dared
not add a third, lest he could not again reach the
heights.</p>

<p class='c008'>His tenth and last symphony in C major takes an hour
to perform and is heard frequently. Robert Schumann
wrote that it was of “Heavenly length.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Schubert lived when the romantic poets gave him wonderful
verse for his texts. He loved the literature of Goethe
and Heinrich Heine, both of whom knew the hearts of the
simple people.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>The world will never forget the wonderful heritage left
by this genius who died at thirty-two leaving vast quantities
of great works. Besides creating new forms in song
he also gave the pianists pieces that were new and important.
He left no concertos, nor did he write for solo violin,
but his piano sonatas and chamber music are of value.
<cite><span lang="de">Der Erl-Koenig</span></cite> (<cite>The Erl King</cite>), <cite><span lang="de">Der Doppelganger</span></cite> (<cite>The
Shadow</cite>), and <cite>Death and the Maiden</cite>, all sounded the last
note in tragedy, and he also wrote many lovely songs in
lighter mood.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Well Favored Mendelssohn</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Most masters who have left the world richer for having
lived, were born in poverty and knew the sorrows of privation,
not so with Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (1809–1847),
loved by the many who have played his <cite>Songs
Without Words</cite>, or who have heard Elman’s fingers fly over
his violin in the concerto, said to be the best writing ever
done for that instrument.</p>

<p class='c008'>Popular as are many works from the polished and fluent
pen of Mendelssohn, the oratorios <cite>Elijah</cite> and <cite>Saint Paul</cite>
are noble for these contain some of the most dramatic and
inspired writing. In that work which is typical of Mendelssohn
and his personality, he showed more characteristics
of the older classical school than of the romantic. If he
had lived during the classical period he would have been a
greater composer, for he was romantic by influence and
classic in taste.</p>

<p class='c008'>Has not the <cite>Spring Song</cite> the shimmer of spring and the
<cite>Spinning Song</cite> the whir of the wheels? One can easily
imagine the kindly touch of a loving hand in <cite>Consolation</cite>,
while the <cite>Hunting Song</cite> is alive and going. This is the
romantic music that became the model for thousands of
small pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>It in said frequently that if Mendelssohn had been less
conventional, his work would have been more forceful,
because he had much that was truly fine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mendelssohn lived among the most brilliant literary lights
of his day. His refinement was reflected in his music. He
was petted by an adoring father, mother and sisters, who
gave him every opportunity to study and compose, and
he was much sought after socially. He devoted much
time to the study of languages, sketching in water colors
and traveling in Italy and Switzerland. His sister Fanny,
whose musical education was of the utmost assistance to
her brother whom she idolized, would have been famous
but for her father’s prejudice against women in professional
life. She was a gifted composer and it is claimed
that she wrote many of her brother’s songs and some of
the <cite>Songs Without Words</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her death was a mortal blow from which Mendelssohn
never recovered. Extremely sensitive, his affection for his
family was most intense and filled his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>His grandfather was the eminent philosopher Moses
Mendelssohn, who being a Hebrew, was open to the sorrows
caused by prejudice. He was such a great man, however,
that he succeeded in breaking down barriers not
only for himself, but for his race.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abraham Mendelssohn was pleased to call himself, “First
the son of the famous Moses Mendelssohn, then the father
of the eminent Felix Mendelssohn.” His banking house in
Berlin is still in the family.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most noted musicians and artists were entertained
in the Mendelssohn home, and heard the compositions of
the gifted young man. In 1821 the boy was taken to
Goethe’s home where he played and improvised for the
poet. He was delighted with him for his musical talent,
and because he had inherited the gift of conversation and
letters from his grandfather, of whom Goethe was very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>fond. Young Mendelssohn never shocked the great old poet
as did Beethoven, for his manner was always correct.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1825 Mendelssohn went to Paris to Cherubini who
was asked whether his talent justified cultivation beyond
the average stage. The master was very enthusiastic,
but his father would not leave him in Paris, even in charge
of the noted teacher. Returning to Berlin he wrote the
overture to <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> (1826). It reflects
the dancing elves and the humor of Shakespeare, while the
orchestra has a delicate touch, similar to that shown by
Berlioz at the same period. Mendelssohn was only seventeen
when he wrote it, with all its finish and its flawless musical
treatment. Much that he did at that period shows
his natural flow of genius. Music seemed to gush from his
soul like pure, fresh water from a spring, making one think
of cool fountains, sparkling with melody and clarity. These
qualities are also in the <cite>Fingal’s Cave</cite> or <cite>Hebrides</cite> overture,
and he takes you on his delightful trips in <cite>Calm Sea and
Prosperous Voyage</cite>. The way these numbers reflect his
impressions and the way he transmitted them to others is
typical of the Romantic School. The purity of his musical
form related him to the classical and gave inklings of the
Symphonic Tone Poem.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his symphonies Mendelssohn also told tales of his
travels, as in the <cite>Italian Symphony</cite>, and in his <cite>Scotch Symphony</cite>
in which he made use of Scotch folk tunes. He
also wrote much chamber music. He left some piano
concertos which may not attract the professionals of
today but are the joy of many piano students who play
them arranged for two pianos.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mendelssohn tried operas but like many others failed
to find a good libretto. This was the trouble with one he
produced in Berlin. Added to this there were many intrigues
and jealousies at the opera house which turned
him bitterly against that city.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>However, he accomplished one of the greatest things
ever done for music. The works of Bach and Handel had
been so neglected that they were almost forgotten. He
knew them well, and wanting others to love them as he did,
he assembled a great chorus and gave Bach’s <cite>Passion according
to Saint Matthew</cite>. This was the first performance
since Bach’s death, and it brought these works back to us.
Imagine Mendelssohn’s popularity and talent as a conductor
to have been able to do this at the age of twenty!
Then he traveled again, and after roaming through Italy,
Switzerland and France, he went to London where he
created a stir as pianist, composer and conductor. Besides
his splendid education he had a winsome and attractive
personality, and his success was very great. He made, in
all, nine visits to England.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having been brought up in the Christian faith, he married
the daughter of a French Protestant minister and
had five children. They went to live in Germany and
becoming conductor of the Leipsic Gewandhaus orchestra,
he made the city the musical center of Germany.
He founded the Leipsic Conservatory of Music (1843),
where he gave his old teacher Moscheles an important
post. This conservatory is well known here for many
American musicians of the last generation were educated
there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mendelssohn conducted many festivals and he always
aroused new interest in Bach, whom he presented at every
opportunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>His <cite>Saint Paul</cite> had success in Duesseldorf (1837), and
during his last visit to England (1846), he gave at the
Birmingham festival <cite>Elijah</cite>, second today in popularity
only to Handel’s <cite>Messiah</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Mendelssohn returned to Leipsic, he showed
traces of overwork and the death of his sister coming at
the same time, made him unable to resist the strain. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>died November 4, 1847, when only 38. His happy life
shines through his music so full of beauty and sunshine.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Schumann—The Supreme Poet</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Robert Schumann (1810–1856), a tower of beauty,
strength, imagination and dramatic fervor even judged
by 20th century standards, still thrills us as we recognize
his genius. What a price he paid for his life filled with
joys and griefs!</p>

<p class='c008'>We are grateful for the solidity of his building, his
breadth of vision, the wonders of his imagination, the
beauty of his poetic fancy, and above all, the vastness of
his musical knowledge. A peak among the composers of
the Romantic School, he has scaled the heights of dramatic
fervor as he has touched the sun-flecked valleys. To him we
owe the naming of pieces, and the feeling of emotion which
the composer felt when he named them,—<cite>The Happy
Farmer</cite>, <cite>The Prophet Bird</cite>, <cite>The Rocking-Horse</cite>, <cite>End of the
Song</cite>, <cite>The Child Falls Asleep</cite>, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>All who have been milestones in music have been well
educated, yet how unjustly people say musicians know
nothing but music. Many have not had only culture from
their studies, but also have come from refined homes. So
Schumann, born at Zwickau, Saxony, had an educated
father, a book-seller. His mother wanted Robert to be a
lawyer, and did not wish his musical talent to interfere.
He began to compose and study music at seven, but he
studied law, literature and philosophy, later, at the University
of Leipsic.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a year he went to the famous University of Heidelberg
(1829), which has always been proud that the great
composer was one of its students.</p>

<p class='c008'>Schumann returned to Leipsic on account of the musical
life. With his return began the romance of his life, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>of the most beautiful love stories in musical history. He
studied with Frederick Wieck, whose little daughter Clara
was a prodigy pianist. He became a member of the household
and was charmed by the talent of the child. Meanwhile
he was studying as pianist, and being ingenious,
he invented an instrument to develop his weak fourth
finger, but it ruined his hand and unfitted him for his
career.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now he gave more attention to composition and to
musical criticism. This gave him the chance to help some
of the brilliant musicians of the day. He brought Chopin
to the notice of Germany, and proclaimed the genius of
young Johannes Brahms. He also formed a deep friendship
for Mendelssohn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Valuable as are all writings which reveal his thoughts,
his richest gift to the world was his music, in which he
preached the gospel of beauty.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Schumann grew into manhood he began to know the
depths of sorrow, some of his finest works having been an
outburst of his tortured soul. Clara Wieck was now a
young woman and a great pianist. It was natural that
an affection should spring up between them. But Clara’s
father had greater hopes. He could not see a struggling
young musician and critic as the husband of his talented
child. During this long and painful courtship when Schumann
dared not speak his love to Clara he wrote compositions
with which to tell his story, and she understood. One
of these expressions was the lovely <cite><span lang="de">Warum</span></cite> asking the
question, “Why?” so longingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>In those days a case could be brought into court and the
reason demanded why a parent should refuse to allow a
marriage. Schumann went to law, and the court decided
that Wieck’s objections were without cause. But the year
of strain told upon his health and nerves and he began
his married life under a cloud of illness. The young pair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>were ideally happy, he wrote glorious music, and she took
pride in playing his piano works on all her programs.</p>

<p class='c008'>With all her accomplishments—and she was a great
artist—she was first a devoted wife who cared for her
husband as though he had been her child. Schumann’s
very finest work was done during these years. His inspiration
drove him chiefly to songs, full of lyric beauty like
Schubert’s; indeed, when speaking of <i><span lang="de">lieder</span></i> the names of
Schubert and Schumann are always linked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mendelssohn urged Schumann to teach in the Leipsic
Conservatory, but he left there soon to make a tour of
Russia with his wife. That year they settled in Dresden,
a quieter city, because his nerves were beginning to forecast
the shadow of his future.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mendelssohn loved Schumann and admired him as composer,
writer and critic. He conducted the first performance
of Schumann’s B flat symphony at a Gewandhaus
concert of Clara Schumann, and the happiness of the
three was tremendous. Schumann did not think of himself
alone, but was always trying to help his colleagues.
Schubert wrote his C major symphony in March of the
year he died and never heard it, but Schumann had the
score sent to Mendelssohn in Leipsic for its first performance
after a wait of eleven years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding his nerves, Schumann was now in his
full power and the amount he wrote is incredible. Most of
his chamber music was written in 1842, three of the string
quartets being dedicated to Mendelssohn. The work that
gave him fame all over Europe was the quintet for piano and
strings, opus 44; with Clara at the piano, Berlioz heard
its first performance and spread the news of his genius
through Paris. About this time the <cite>Variations for Two
Pianos</cite> were written and played by Robert and Clara
Schumann.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another interesting and popular number is <cite>Carnaval</cite>, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>collection of named sketches in three-four time each one
portraying some person or thing. <cite>Eusebius</cite> and <cite>Florestan</cite>
have caused much curiosity—the secret is that Schumann
was a student of himself and these were meant to show
his conflicting moods. Chopin is represented, also Mendelssohn,
while <cite><span lang="it">Chiarina</span></cite> is Clara.</p>

<p class='c008'>A strange thing happened to Schumann in Vienna. He
was visiting the graves of Beethoven and Schubert which
are not far apart, and he found a steel pen on Beethoven’s
tomb. He took this for an omen, but used it only for his
most precious works. He wrote the B flat symphony with
it and the magic seemed to work!</p>

<p class='c008'>Schubert is universally praised for the beauty of his
themes, but who could surpass the loveliness of Schumann’s
melodies? The contrasts between the exquisite little tone-pictures
of <cite>Kinderscenen</cite> and the grandeur of the sonatas
and the <cite><span lang="it">Fantasia</span></cite> mark the breadth of his genius, while the
amount he accomplished in his short span of life was
marvelous.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was but twenty-five when he first showed mental
trouble, and at forty-four his case was hopeless. He tried
to end his life by jumping into the Rhine and was taken
to an asylum near Beethoven’s birthplace, Bonn, where he
died two years later, survived by his wife and two daughters.</p>

<p class='c008'>What a price he paid for his life filled with joys and
griefs!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chopin—“Proudest Poet-Soul”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Robert Schumann wrote that Chopin was “the boldest,
proudest poet-soul of his time.” Such a tribute from him
meant more than all the praise we can give him now; it
shows that he had admiration and respect from his rivals
as he had idolatry from the literary, artistic and refined
circles of Paris.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Frederic Chopin (1809–1849) was born in Poland of a
French father and a Polish mother. The difference one
finds in the date of his birth, February 22 or March 1, is
owing to the difference between the Russian and Polish
calendars, and those of other countries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like Mozart he showed talent very early and at nine
played his first public concert. His mother, unable to be
present, asked him what the audience liked best. “My
collar, Mamma!” he answered, proud of the little lace
collar on the black velvet jacket! He was elegant then,
and always kept his air of distinction, and a love for
beauty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after beginning music study, Chopin tried to
compose, and felt such authority that he undertook to
change certain things written by his teacher. His earliest
work was a march dedicated to the Grand Duke Constantin,
which was arranged for brass-band and printed without the
composer’s name.</p>

<p class='c008'>From his two teachers in Poland, both ardent patriots,
Chopin must have absorbed much of the national feeling
so strongly marked in his works. As it was a day of flashy
<em>salon</em> (Page <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) playing, his teacher, Joseph Elsner, felt
that Chopin was the founder of a new school in which
poetic feeling was leading music out of the prevailing empty
acrobatic finger feats!</p>

<p class='c008'>The world owes much to that wise teacher who instilled
a love of Bach into his young pupil. He answered some
one who blamed him for allowing Chopin too much freedom:
“Leave him alone! he treads an extraordinary path
because he has extraordinary gifts and follows no method,
but creates one. I have never seen such a gift for composition.”
Later he marked his examination papers:
“Chopin, Frederic (pupil for three years), astounding capacity,
musical genius.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At fifteen Chopin was adored by his companions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>always held the affection of those who knew him. He seems
to have been the original “matinee idol” of Paris, whenever
he played, for he was the most poetic and finest pianist
ever heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though Chopin was seemingly French in manner, habits
and tastes, he was extraordinarily patriotic and his music
is perhaps the finest expression of Poland the world has
ever seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one has surpassed, or even equalled Chopin in writing
for the piano. He understood its possibilities, limitations,
tonal qualities and power to express emotion.</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not leave a great quantity of compositions, but a
well-ordered collection of music, so individual that even
today, with all his imitators, when we hear Chopin—(and
where is there a piano recital without at least one number?)—we
instantly recognize it as his.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strongly marked rhythms are among his most fascinating
characteristics. He glorified and elaborated the
dances of Poland, as had others in the past, who made art
pieces of the gavotte, minuet, bourrée, gigue, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>What lovelier numbers on a program than Chopin’s
mazurkas, polonaises, waltzes? There is also irresistible
swing in the <cite><span lang="fr">Ballades</span></cite>, <cite>Impromptus</cite>, the <cite><span lang="fr">Berceuse</span></cite>, <cite>Barcarolle</cite>,
and what could rival in fantasy the <cite><span lang="fr">Nocturnes</span></cite> or <cite>Preludes</cite>?
The <cite>Etudes</cite> cover a variety of moods, while his <cite>Scherzos</cite>
stand alone in piano literature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chopin left no symphonies, no chamber music, except
two piano sonatas and one for ’cello and piano, and what
he did for voice could be told in a few words. He also wrote
two piano concertos in which the piano work is beautiful
but the orchestration is not as fine.</p>

<p class='c008'>These concertos and his piano sonatas were the largest
forms in which he wrote, proving that he could have succeeded
here had he not chosen to perfect music in the
smaller forms.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Chopin never had a fair start in life in the way of health,
and while his delicate appearance made him the more
interesting, especially to the ladies, he was a real sufferer.
It would be unfair to believe that his work would
have been greater had he enjoyed complete health, for
his unhappiness and his sufferings gave him a sense of the
mysterious and the beyond. He lived in a world far from
material things and seemed able to translate all he felt
into music.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had the devotion of many idolizing friends, tireless in
their efforts to make him happy and keep him working so
that he should not brood over his illness (tuberculosis).
Foremost among these was the famous French novelist
George Sand, whose love and companionship were the
source of rare inspiration and comfort. She was a woman
of vast mental and physical power and seemed to impart
her strength to him. But Chopin was a favorite not only
with women but among the men, as we learn through the
letters he left. We find many from Schumann, Mendelssohn,
Liszt, Delacroix, the French painter, and innumerable
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Concertizing began to fatigue him beyond endurance.
Returning to Paris from a tour during a hard winter in
England, he grew so ill that he rarely left his bed, although
he did not die until the following October, 1849.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chopin had asked that the Mozart Requiem be given
at his funeral, which occurred October 30, from the Madeleine
Church in Paris. The singer Lablache who had sung
the Mozart number at Beethoven’s funeral also performed
this tribute for Chopin.</p>

<p class='c008'>In addition to the Requiem, Lefebure-Wely, one of the
fine organists of Paris, played Chopin’s preludes in B and
E minor, and the familiar funeral march from the first
sonata was arranged for orchestra and played for the first
time.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Heller—The Children’s Chopin</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We may not find the name of Stephen Heller (1813–1888)
on many of the “grown-up” programs, but no pupils’
recitals are complete without several of his lovely melodies.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was the friend of children and devoted himself more
to teaching and writing for the young minds and small
hands than did any of his companions. Heller was intended
for a lawyer, but his talent as shown at nine was
great enough for him to study with Carl Czerny in Vienna.
He became a fine concert pianist and toured Europe.
Taken ill during one of these tours, he was adopted by a
wealthy family who allowed him all the time he wanted for
composing. Most of his study was done in Paris where
he was a friend of Berlioz, Chopin, Liszt and other prominent
artists of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>He left several hundred piano pieces, nearly all masterpieces
in a field where he stands practically alone. He
wrote in the style developed by Mendelssohn and Schumann,
and what Chopin is to the music world of the
“grown-ups,” Heller is to the young student.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXV<br> <span class='c016'>Wagner—the Wizard</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>Wilhelm Richard Wagner</span><br> 1813–1883</h4>

<p class='c018'>Richard Wagner, the Wizard, called out of the past
a vast company of gods and goddesses, giants, knights
and heroes, kings and queens. He made them live for
us with all their joys and sorrows, loves and hates, in his
great music dramas, for which he has been recognized as
one of the rare geniuses of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Evoked by his music-magic they pass before us,—the
gods and heroes of Walhalla,—Wotan, Brünnhilde, valiant
Siegfried, Pfafner the giant who is turned into a
dragon, Mime the dwarf, the Rhine Maidens and the
Valkyries; Parsifal the guileless youth who became the
Knight of the Holy Grail, and Lohengrin his son, the
beautiful knight who marries Elsa, a lady of rank of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>We see the minnesingers Tannhäuser and Wolfram von
Eschenbach in one of their famous Minstrel Tournaments
with the hand of the lovely Elizabeth as a prize; we also
meet the lovable shoemaker-mastersinger Hans Sachs in
Nüremberg, of the 16th century, and David his merry
apprentice, lovely Eva Pogner and the charming knight
Walter von Stolzing, and Beckmesser the clownish mastersinger;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>then there are the imperious Irish Queen, Isolde
and Tristan, her lover, with Kurvenal his faithful servant.
Wagner makes not only the mythological persons
relive but he brings back realistic pictures of the everyday
life and customs of the German people of the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wagner had his idea of what opera should be and nothing
short of his ideal interested him. He kept to his purpose
and accomplished miraculous things whether he
suffered or starved or was banished from his country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Richard was born at a time, favorable for hearing and
knowing the Viennese composers of the 18th and early
19th centuries, who had increased the importance of the
orchestra. He could hear too the music of Schumann and
Schubert, with all the new beauty and warm feeling they
radiated. This new depth appeared not only in the orchestra
but also in piano and vocal music. In Wagner’s time,
people felt deeply about everything,—science, philosophy,
literature, and especially politics; and many were the
quarrels and discontents among nations. Even our own
country was torn by a cruel war.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wagner listened to the works of Mozart and of Beethoven,
whom he admired immensely. He approved of
Beethoven’s use of the chorus in the <cite>Ninth Symphony</cite>,
which had no little effect on his work and ideals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the people who most influenced Wagner was
Gluck, who first fought for sincerity and truth in opera
drama. Gluck did not have the advantage of the grown up
orchestra and freer forms, yet Gluck did so much to free
opera that Wagner was fortunate indeed to have come
after him. Another great influence was Weber, who mixed
everyday story in a delightful play of fancy and picturesqueness.
Wagner, after hearing Weber’s <cite><span lang="de">Die Freischütz</span></cite>,
was very much impressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meyerbeer, a contemporary, although rather artificial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>and always working for effects, nevertheless showed Wagner
the value of gorgeous scenic productions. Wagner was
fond of the stage, and Meyerbeer’s big scenes sank into
the mind of the young composer-poet, who liked to be
called a poet rather than a musician!</p>

<p class='c008'>Musically, Franz Liszt was probably the greatest influence
in Wagner’s life and we often hear in Wagner’s works bits
of melody which remind us of Liszt.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not fair to say that he was great just because he
followed Gluck, Weber, and Mozart, for he brought music
out of its old ruts and was copied by hundreds of composers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hero of this chapter was born in Leipsic in 1813 and
was the youngest of nine children. His father died shortly
after his birth and his mother married an actor playwright
named Geyer and they all went to live in Dresden. His
stepfather felt that Richard had musical gifts and he
proved a very kind and wise parent. He died when the
boy was only eight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Richard must have been a most interesting little chap,
for he always did everything with what we would call
“pep” and persistence. He loved poetry and was devoted
to the theatre. His stepfather had always allowed him to
go “back stage” at the playhouse, so the youth became
familiar with stage craft, which he used later in producing
his music dramas.</p>

<p class='c008'>He read the Greek and German poets and dramatists
at a very early age. He was the first of the musical geniuses
to be trained in the arts before he started music.
So we can picture a little chap, “stage-struck,” studying
when he should, seeing plays when he could, and listening
to the works of Weber and Beethoven which enchanted
him, and storing up ideas, but as yet showing no great
leaning toward music as a profession.</p>

<p class='c008'>The family moved back to Leipsic in 1827 where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>went to school until he entered the university in 1831.
He heard much orchestral music and became so deeply
charmed with Beethoven, that he copied the <cite>Ninth Symphony</cite>
from a score, to become familiar with it. The <cite>Ninth
Symphony</cite> with chorale takes about two hours to perform,
imagine how long it took to copy it! An instance of
the wizard’s energy and “stick-to-it-iveness”!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A Killing Play</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>He began to study music with C. G. Müller, for Beethoven’s
works made him decide that he wanted to know
more. He also was taught by Theodore Weinlig, the cantor
or singer of St. Thomas’ school. At sixteen, he wrote a
play which had so tragic a plot that he killed off forty-two
of the characters, and afterwards said, he had to bring some
back as ghosts to wind up the drama, for there were no
characters left alive! His drama reading made him exaggerate
tragedy in his own play! After this he wrote a sonata,
a polonaise and a symphony, in classic style, performed
in 1833.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1830 there had been a political revolution in Germany
and it greatly impressed the young man for he was an
independent thinker in politics as well as in music.</p>

<p class='c008'>He visited Vienna in 1832 but he found it so appreciative
of Hérold’s opera <cite><span lang="it">Zampa</span></cite> and Strauss’ waltzes that he
could not bear it and left almost immediately. He was
much like Beethoven in disposition for he was quick to
anger and kind in great gusts, and could be most agreeable
to his friends.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>His Early Operas</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>He had gone to Vienna with his symphony but showed
it to no one; it is said that Mendelssohn saw it but forgot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>about it. Here he wrote the poem and some poor music
for an opera <cite><span lang="de">Die Hochzeit</span></cite> (<cite>The Wedding</cite>) which he tore up
the next year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then off to Prague went he (1832), and wrote his first
libretto, for you must remember he did not go to people
like Metastastio or Molière for his libretto but wrote his
own. Had he not been a composer he certainly would
have been a literary man. In fact, he was, for he wrote
more pamphlets and books than many a writer! Yet, he
showed his real genius as a composer.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he was so poor now that he was glad to get a job as
a chorus master at the mean salary of 10 florins ($5) a
month! It was here he wrote the opera <cite><span lang="de">Die Feen</span></cite> (<cite>The
Fairies</cite>) a wildly romantic work, after which he returned
again to Leipsic. For the first time he heard Wilhelmine
Schroeder-Devrient sing, whose marvelous talent influenced
him all his life. In 1834 as a conductor of a troupe
with headquarters in Magdeburg, he tried to produce his
second opera the tragic <cite><span lang="de">Das Liebesverbot</span></cite> (<cite>Forbidden Love</cite>),
modeled after Shakespeare’s <cite>Measure for Measure</cite>; but it
was so badly given that it was a dismal failure. The
second was like Bellini and Auber, both of whom he admired
and it was too early in his life (twenty-one) to show
new ways of composing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon he went to Königsberg, where (1836) he married
Wilhelmina Planer, a young actress whom he met in the
theatre, and he spent the year trying to get his Magdeburg
troupe out of difficulties. Later he was given a post
in Riga.</p>

<p class='c008'>While at Riga his duty was to lead orchestral concerts,
at many of which Ole Bull the Norwegian violinist played,
here too, he read <cite>Rienzi</cite> of Bulwer-Lytton, the English
writer, and wrote a libretto and opera on the showy model
of Meyerbeer. He said himself that it “out-Meyerbeered
Meyerbeer.” Leaving hastily, debts and all, with <cite>Rienzi</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>in his hand, he went to Paris (the goal of all composers)
in a sailing vessel, with his new wife and a dog named
Robber, stopping over in England. The trip took four
long perilous weeks. From the sailors he learned the story
of the Flying Dutchman, which he afterwards used in
his opera of that name.</p>

<p class='c008'>We wish we could tell you the whole story of this gale-tossed,
unhappy mariner, the Flying Dutchman, and how
at last he found happiness and relief from storms and
troubles of life by finding his mate in the maiden Senta.
You will love the music and the story which is woven about
Senta in the beautiful ballad bearing her name.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this opera, Wagner first used the <em>leit-motif</em> or leading
theme (particularly in the overture) which he used as we
use a name or description of a person, idea or thing, except
that he used them in music instead of in words. For example,
when Senta comes in to the story, either as someone’s
thought or as a person, or when she is spoken of, her
theme is heard, woven into the music. So it is when Siegfried
appears in the operas of the <cite>Ring of the Nibelungen</cite>,
you hear the Siegfried theme; when the Gold is mentioned,
you hear the Gold theme; or if the Giants appear,
their theme is heard,—so it is with the Dragon and everything
connected with the story. You hear in some form,
their name plates, as it were, and so by listening, you can
follow just what is going on through the music. This is
one of the things that Wagner developed, though Gluck
and others had attempted to use it.</p>

<p class='c008'>During his stay in Paris, he had a struggle for existence
and did everything possible to gain a livelihood, while
striving to get a hearing for his compositions. He wrote,
in his misery, the <cite>Faust Overture</cite>, the first work to win
recognition.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went to see Meyerbeer on his way to Paris, for Meyerbeer
was very popular and his approval could have aided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>poor Richard. Some say Meyerbeer helped him and others
say he did not. Wagner gained little from him. Even
when he first went to see Liszt, who later became his best
friend, it is said that Liszt snubbed him. Wagner never
stopped writing his theories for the papers, and a hot-headed
young scribbler he was! Yet withal he submitted the
story of <cite>The Flying Dutchman</cite> to the director of the Paris
Opera House who rejected it as an opera, but gave the story
to Dietsch, the conductor, to write the music. This did
not daunt Wagner, who, after a defeat, worked harder or
his next task. So he wrote another <cite>Flying Dutchman</cite>,
story and music and orchestration in seven weeks!</p>

<p class='c008'>However, luck began to favor him, and <cite>Rienzi</cite> (1842) was
accepted by the Dresden Opera and was so successful that
he became conductor in Dresden, which saved him for a
while from money worries, and <cite>The Flying Dutchman</cite>,
which had gone begging so long, was loudly demanded.
Strange to say, this wonderful legend did not succeed, for
the people missed the little tricks of Meyerbeer and they
could not understand the flowing music in new form.
Wagner was very disappointed for the story was one of the
old German (Teuton) legends and he thought the German
people would love it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, however, Spohr gave it with great success at
Cassel, and won Wagner’s gratitude for his understanding
and kindness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now comes <cite>Tannhäuser</cite>, an entrancing legend which
inspired him to study more deeply into the Teutonic legends.
This he produced in Dresden, and other German
cities played it later. Everything became topsy-turvy in
the musical and political world. Wagner was writing fiery
things about freedom in music and politics, nothing to
amount to much, but enough to rouse his enemies, who
became hateful and hissed <cite>Tannhäuser</cite>,—calling it nerve-killing,
distressing music without melody. How could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>anyone fail to find melody in <cite>Oh Thou Sublime Sweet Evening
Star</cite>, the <cite>Pilgrim’s Chorus</cite>, the <cite>Venusburg</cite> music and
the colorful overture with themes of the whole opera?
Yet music affects people this way when it is new in structure.
“There is no melody” is said today when the so-called
modern music is played. This should make us stop
and listen carefully and look back on what happened to the
writers of the past when they dared differ from the crowd.
Perhaps calling your attention to this will make you listen
with open ears and open minds to the new, which so soon
becomes the familiar.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Wagner, while conducting other operas in Dresden,
began on <cite>Lohengrin</cite> and finished it in 1847. But he was
impetuous and his written articles irritated the people.
His ideas were fiery and his musical speech so odd, that
even Schumann, who was very sympathetic, only partially
understood him or his music. However he did say that
Wagner would have a great influence on German opera,
but Mendelssohn, after hearing <cite>Tannhäuser</cite>, only liked
the second finale. Even his friend Madame Devrient,
though she loved and admired him, said: “You are a man
of genius but you write such eccentric stuff, it is hardly
possible to sing it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Never did Wagner feel that he was at fault, so great was
his faith in his ideas of doing away with arias, of not having
stopping places in an opera, just to begin some other
song, and of making the words equally important to the
music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Nibelungen Ring</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>While working at <cite>Lohengrin</cite> he had started his studies
of the Icelandic and Germanic Saga, the <cite>Nibelungenlied</cite>.
These tales changed under his pen into the story of Siegfried,
which he wove into the trilogy known as <cite>The Nibelungen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>Ring</cite> or <cite>Trilogy with a Prologue</cite>, as he called it, and
as we call it now—<cite>The Tetralogy</cite> (in four parts).</p>

<p class='c008'>The four dramas of the <cite>Ring of the Nibelung</cite> are:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) <cite>The Rhine Gold</cite> (<cite><span lang="de">Das Rheingold</span></cite>)</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) <cite>Valkyrie</cite> (<cite><span lang="de">Die Walküre</span></cite>)</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) <cite>Siegfried</cite></p>

<p class='c008'>(4) <cite>The Twilight of the Gods</cite> (<cite><span lang="de">Die Götterdämmerung</span></cite>)</p>

<p class='c008'>Many things happen in these tales but it takes the four
to tell the one big story:</p>

<p class='c008'>Alberich the wicked Nibelung, a gnome, in his greed
steals the gold from the Rhine Maidens who were guarding
it, hidden in the Rhine. They tell him that the one who
fashions a ring out of the gold will rule the world, but must
forego love. Alberich makes the ring but Wotan the god
of the gods wrests it from him. During the drama various
people secure the Ring but it had been cursed by Alberich
and brings disaster to all who get it. Finally the very
gods themselves are doomed to destruction, and Brünnhilde
the oldest of the Valkyries, the daughters of Wotan, returns
the stolen treasure to the waters of the Rhine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Wizard has painted in magnificent music the great
Rhine River, flowing across the stage; the fire surrounding
Brünnhilde until she is rescued by the valiant Siegfried,
who knows no fear; Valhalla the home of the gods; the
hunt in which Siegfried drinks from the magic horn of
memory; and his funeral pyre into which Brünnhilde casts
herself and her horse carrying the ring which she has
taken from Siegfried’s finger back to the Rhine Maidens
from whence it came.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scenes are gigantic and so is the music. Wagner,
with his ideals for freedom and the betterment of humanity,
used these legends as a cloak to cover his personal opinions
which would have been looked upon as anarchism if he had
not used such clever and artistic symbols. In Alberich’s
greed for the gold, is hidden Wagner’s ideas of the Government’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>greed for power against which he had fought so
strenuously. Another lesson is that anyone possessing the
gold is denied love, showing that greed kills human
feelings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because the Opera at Dresden did not use the things he
liked, he rebelled openly against the popular political and
musical ideas; he was banished and went to Zürich, Switzerland.
Here he wrote more fiery literature and made
more enemies and a few friends, and the enmity he stirred
up against himself delayed his success. He hoped for a
better state of political life in order to write freer and more
beautiful music.</p>

<p class='c008'>While he was in Zürich, Liszt, in Vienna, produced <cite>Lohengrin</cite>
with success. It was given to celebrate Goethe’s birthday
(1850), before a brilliant audience, and now Wagner’s
fame seemed sure, though his “pockets were empty.”
<cite>Lohengrin’s</cite> success was slow in Germany, as it took about
nine years to reach Berlin and Dresden. It was thought to
be without melody! Can you hear Lohengrin’s song to the
Swan, the Wedding March or the Prelude? Listen to it
in your mind’s ear or auralize it! Wagner’s themes were so
marvelously interwoven and he did such amazing things
with his orchestra, that it was difficult for people to unravel
the torrential new music. They were not prepared for endless
music flowing on like speech, suiting the music to the
word and not stopping the action to show off the singer’s
skill. What Gluck <em>tried</em> to do, Wagner did. His operas
were music dramas because the action or drama was his
first thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>For fifteen years in exile, he gave himself to literary
work and composition. He had ample time now to write
of his musical theories and his feelings about life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon, London called him to lead the Philharmonic Society,
which he did during the time he was completing <cite>Valkyrie</cite>
and sketching <cite>Siegfried</cite>. He tried to interest the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>English in Beethoven and others whom he loved, but of
little avail. The people preferred the delightful delicacy of
Mendelssohn to the solidity of Beethoven. So here again
he made more enemies than friends, and his bitter pen did
not help to smooth things over. By the time he left London,
he had finished the <cite>Valkyrie</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this great music drama, he tells the story of Siegmund
and Sieglinda, Brünnhilde and the Valkyries who
carried the dead warriors from the battle fields on their
saddles to Valhalla. You hear in the galloping music of
the <cite>Ride of the Valkyries</cite> and the <cite>Fire Music</cite> and <cite>Love Song</cite>
of the first act, such music as never was written by anyone
but Wagner! Oh, it is a wonderful legend, explaining
itself, in Wagner’s own poems and with the short music
name tags (leit-motifs) which are enlarged and turned
around and intermingled with other name tags and which
stand out beautifully when you know how to listen.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tristan and Isolde and Meistersinger</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>While in Zürich, Wagner met the merchant Otto Wesendonck,
whose beautiful and poetic wife Wagner loved
dearly. She was a great influence in his life and they were
friends for many years. It was during his friendship that
he started the love drama of <cite>Tristan and Isolde</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1859 he finished the love drama which tells of Tristan
and the lovely Queen of Ireland and how they drank
the love potion and how they loved and were separated.
A noble story with some of the most grippingly beautiful
music ever written!</p>

<p class='c008'>But with this masterpiece of masterpieces completed, he
could get nobody to produce it. Everyone said it was
impossible to sing it, and we know even today that it takes
very special musical gifts and few can do it well. For it
is quite true that Wagner, with all his theories about composition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>thought little of the singer’s throat muscles and
more of what he wanted to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Wagner was disconsolate! He could not get his
works performed and he was still prevented from returning
to Germany, the country he loved. So off he went to Paris
and there <cite>Tannhäuser</cite> failed utterly after three terrible,
turbulent, horrible performances, which almost ended in
riots, no doubt planned ahead by his enemies.</p>

<p class='c008'>But to offset this disaster, he was allowed to return home
and everyone rejoiced in his arrival. No doubt his treatment
in Paris softened the German heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not long after this Wagner and his wife separated and
some years later in 1871, he married Cosima Liszt, who
had been the wife of Hans von Bülow.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Wagner conducted opera on a tour through Russia,
Hungary, Bohemia (Czecho-Slovakia) and many German
cities, Ludwig II, King of Bavaria, sent for Wagner and
offered him an income, and from this time on Wagner composed
without financial worries. He was commissioned in
1865 to complete <cite>The Ring</cite>, and <cite>Tristan and Isolde</cite> was
performed by Hans von Bülow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again political intrigues and his enemies drove him to
Switzerland, and after <cite>Tristan and Isolde</cite> was given and
while he was in Switzerland, he completed <cite>The Ring</cite> and
<cite><span lang="de">Die Meistersinger</span></cite>, the most beautiful comic opera in the
world, which was also produced by von Bülow in Munich,
June 21st, 1868. And now we fulfill our promise to you,
which we made in Chapter VIII about the Meistersinger:</p>

<p class='c008'>Walther von Stolzing, a young knight, falls in love at
first sight with Eva the beautiful daughter of Pogner,
the goldsmith of Nüremberg, who has promised her to the
winning singer in the coming Festival of the Mastersingers.
Beckmesser, the old town clerk, counts on winning as he
also loves Eva. As Walther does not belong to the music
guild, he has to pass the examination. Beckmesser gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>him so many bad marks for not keeping the committee’s
rules that he is not admitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Hans Sachs, the greatest Meistersinger of all, the
town cobbler, thought Walther a beautiful singer even
though he broke musical laws and the very freedom and
the new loveliness in his music charmed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the evening when Walther and Eva try to run away,
Beckmesser decides to serenade Eva. Hans Sachs, cobbling
shoes in his doorway interrupts Beckmesser’s ludicrous
serenade with a jolly song, in which he marks all Beckmesser’s
mistakes with his hammer, just as Beckmesser had
marked Walther’s. The neighborhood is aroused, confusion
follows, Beckmesser gets a beating and Hans Sachs
slips Eva and Walther into his own house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next day Walther sings a song to Hans which he has
dreamed and Hans writes it down. Beckmesser comes in
and finding the words steals them, sure he could win if he
sang a song of Hans Sachs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beckmesser fails miserably and Sachs calls on Walther to
sing it. Here he sings Walther’s <cite>Prize Song</cite>, which wins
the approval of the Meistersingers, and the prize—lovely
Eva.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here we get a splendid idea of what Wagner felt about
new music, for in the <cite><span lang="de">Meistersinger</span></cite> he tried to picture the
jealousies of composers, who condemned the beauty of
his inspiration and new ideas and methods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never was there an opera more delightful for young
people, who love the melodies and charming pictures of
medieval Nüremberg.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bayreuth</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>About this time the <cite>Valkyrie</cite> and <cite>Rhinegold</cite> had been
given at the Court Theatre in Munich (1869–1870). The
King gave up his plan to build a new theatre for these stupendous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>works, which needed special machinery because
of the elaborate stage effects. Wagner insisted that scenery
was as important as the words and music. So he
started to build, by general subscription over all Europe,
a theatre at Bayreuth. He succeeded so well that not only
did Europe contribute but America, too, and groups
of people banded together to collect money for it. Wagner
was now the fashion and finally the new opera house opened
August 13th, 1876, with <cite>The Ring</cite>, for he had finished
<cite><span lang="de">Die Götterdämmerung</span></cite> the year before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Artistically it was successful but not financially. If his
pen had been dipped in honey and not in bitters, he would
have won his public more easily, but he seemed unable to
be diplomatic. So off he went to London and other places
to conduct concerts to make money to pay the debts of
his new theatre. Later he wrote the Festival March, for
the Philadelphia Centennial (1876), which helped financially.</p>

<p class='c008'>The people were divided into two camps,—those for
Wagner, and those against him. So strong was the feeling,
that during the 1880’s, in Germany, signs in cafés
read: “It is forbidden to discuss religion or Wagner”!
The proprietors wished to save their chairs and china
which the fists of their patrons would destroy.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Parsifal</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>During this time he was at work on <cite>Parsifal</cite>, a drama in
music as serious as oratorio yet with the most thrilling
stage effects and richness of music. <cite>Parsifal</cite>, <cite>Tristan and
Isolde</cite>, <cite>The Ring</cite> and <cite><span lang="de">Die Meistersinger</span></cite> are to every other
opera what a plum pudding is, compared to a graham
cracker. In fact, all Wagner’s late music dramas are like
plum puddings, so rich and compact are they.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite>Parsifal</cite> was produced in 1882 in Bayreuth and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>not given again for six years. Later it was the occasion for
yearly pilgrimages to Bayreuth, as if to a shrine. It is so
long that it takes the better part of an afternoon and evening
to perform it, yet you sit enraptured before its gripping
spell of beauty and holiness.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1903 the musical world was startled by the first performance
in America of <cite>Parsifal</cite>, as Wagner, in his will,
had forbidden a stage performance outside of Bayreuth.
It was covered by copyright until 1913, which was supposed
to have protected it from performance. Heinrich
Conried, director of the Metropolitan Opera Company in
New York City, in his eagerness for novelties, disregarded
the master’s wish, and mounted an elaborate production
under the direction of Alfred Hertz. This so offended
the Wagner family that they refused to allow anyone who
had taken part in that performance to appear in Bayreuth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bayreuth became a Mecca, to which pilgrims went every
other year, to attend the festivals. After the World War,
Wagner’s family turned to America for help to continue
these festivals, interrupted by the war, as the Wizard
himself had done, when building his theatre. In 1924 his
son, Siegfried, visited America, conducted some symphony
concerts and secured funds to carry on the festivals.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite>Parsifal</cite> is a combination of three legends—of which
one is the <cite>Parsifal</cite> of our old friend the Minnesinger Wolfram
von Eschenbach (1204). (Chapter VIII.)</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the story of the Redemption of Mankind, told in
symbols with great beauty of poetry, music and scenery.
It is certain to fill you with religious fervor, for it reaches
the depths of your soul and raises you above the things of
the earth. Amfortas, the guardian of the Holy Grail, whose
wound represents the suffering of mankind, hears the mystic
voice of his father, Titurel, who tells him that not until a
sinless one comes with pity in his heart will the wound be
healed. Parsifal, “the guileless fool,” is his redeemer.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>The year following the first production of <cite>Parsifal</cite>
Wagner’s health began to fail and he went to Venice where
he died suddenly in 1883. He was buried with fitting
honors at Bayreuth which always honors the memory of
the Great Master of German Opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is a picture of Wagner in the words of his brother-in-law:
“the double aspect of this powerful personality
was shown in his face; the upper part beautiful with a
vast ideality, and lighted with eyes which were deep and
severe, gentle or malicious, according to the circumstances;
the lower part wry and sarcastic. A mouth cold and calculating
and pursed up, was cut slantingly into a face
beneath an imperious nose, and above a chin which projected
like the menace of a conquering will.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>How the Wizard Changed Opera</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When Wagner reached his full power, he composed
drama rather than opera in the old sense.</p>

<p class='c008'>His music explained the words and action and expressed
the state of mind of the character.</p>

<p class='c008'>The melodies are used very much like the theme in a
sonata. These leit-motifs (leading motives) are usually
carried, as we told you, in the weavings of his wonderful
orchestral webs. This theme or leit-motif or name tag,
is tossed from instrument to instrument in numberless entrancing
ways. Sometimes he uses a flickering theme for
flames as in the fire music of <cite>The Valkyrie</cite> or glorious chimes
or trumpetings as in <cite>Parsifal</cite> to cast a holy spell; but, whatever
he uses, he charms and holds you spellbound.</p>

<p class='c008'>He combines the counterpoint of the 16th century masters,
with a most modern feeling for harmony, inherited
from the classic Germans. He used harmony in a new way
with a freedom it never before had reached, and pointed
the way for modern composers of today.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>As the Wizard, Wagner throws a glamor over the most
mystic happening, as when Siegmund, in <cite><span lang="de">Die Valkyrie</span></cite>,
withdraws the Sword from the tree; or in the most commonplace
fact as when Eva tells Hans Sachs that she has a
nail in her shoe. In <cite>The Meistersinger</cite>, you can always
tell that he is making fun of Beckmesser, because his
name tag shows him to be petty and ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although Wagner’s music is rich, very clear to us and
beautiful, in his day it seemed complicated and discordant,
because of its great volume and sonority, the result
of the perfect part-writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the first time, he makes the brasses of equal importance
to the string and wind instruments. It is thrilling
to hear the trombones and his beautiful use of trumpets.
He used many of Berlioz’s ideas in muffling horns and
added new instruments, too, among them, the bass clarinet
and the English horn (<i><span lang="fr">cor anglais</span></i>), which is a tenor
oboe and not a horn at all!</p>

<p class='c008'>Wagner had a beautiful way of dividing up the parts for
violins and other instruments into smaller choirs which
answered each other and with which he could get special
effects. For example, the Prelude of <cite>Lohengrin</cite> is probably
the nearest thing in shimmering music to what the
angels must play, so heavenly is it. Here he divides the
violins into many parts and it is far more beautiful than
if they all played the same thing. Thus, he gave more
value to the instruments and greatly improved the orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>His preludes in which you hear the leading motives or
name tags, are a table of contents for what follows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wagner did not use tricks of decoration like Meyerbeer
nor did he give show-off pieces for his singers’ benefit.
His idea was to use sincere musical speech to tell the story
and not one bit did he care how hard the singer worked to
carry out his idea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Wagner, above all, was a dramatist, choosing lofty and
noble themes of heroic and ideal subjects in which his
imagination could play. He loved the sublime and the
great spectacle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chief interest of Wagner’s opera is in the orchestra
which carries the theme webs. He used neither the folk
song in its simple beauty nor accepted classic arias which
could be taken out and sung. His song is often declaimed
and appears not to sing with the orchestra, for the voices
are used as instruments and not to show off vocal skill.
Yet, Liszt was quick to take out from the operas and transcribe
for piano the Fire Music, the Ride of the Valkyrie
and many others which we now sing and whistle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, Wagner by his example has given courage to
the man of ideas, if he will believe in himself and work
without ceasing.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVI<br> <span class='c016'>More Opera Makers—Verdi and Meyerbeer to Our Day</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>After reading about the feats of the Wizard it is
not surprising that he had many followers,—those
who openly claimed to take him for an example, and others
who did not realize how much they received from him and
would not like to have been called his followers!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Verdi—The Grand Old Man of Italy</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>After following the Italian methods of writing opera
and having become a very famous composer, Verdi received
inspiration from Wagner in the last three or four
years of his very long life. He was much loved and it is
difficult to tell whether it was his operas or his beautiful
character which prompted the affection. He was called
“the Grand Old Man of Italy.” A national hero was he,
and the Italians’ idol. Praise and flattery did not make him
proud but spurred him to work through trouble and good
fortune, and so he became one of the greatest opera writers.
He was born a few months after Wagner, in the village of
Roncole near Parma, and his life was interesting, for he
lived at the time when opera was popular and was going
through the Wagner upheaval which spread all over Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had a unique chance to make opera more important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>in Italy, and succeeded in giving it a new impetus, even
though in the beginning his popular things followed popular
patterns.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Verdi and the Organ grinder</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Giuseppe Verdi (1813–1901) was the son of an innkeeper
and, as a little boy, showed marked musical talent. He
was a good obedient little fellow, but always rather melancholy
in character and never joined the village boys in
their noisy amusements. “One thing only could rouse
him from his habitual indifference, and that was the occasional
passing through the village of an organ grinder.
To the child, who in after years was to afford an inexhaustible
repertory to those instruments for half a century all
over the world, this was an irresistible attraction. He
could not be kept indoors, and would follow the strolling
player as far as his little legs could carry him.” (Grove’s
Dictionary.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Who has not heard the <cite><span lang="la">Miserere</span></cite> from <cite><span lang="it">Il Trovatore</span></cite> played,
all out of tune, by an Italian organ grinder who sends a
little monkey around with a cup to gather in the pennies?
We remember an organ grinder in San Francisco who
ground out the <cite><span lang="la">Miserere</span></cite>. Each year or two that we returned
there were more of the notes missing. Ten years
later, the performance was quite “toothless” and sounded
very funny.</p>

<p class='c008'>All his life, Verdi kept a little spinet that his father
bought for him in 1820. We see him then, at seven, deep
in musical study and at ten he was the organist of Roncole,
going to school in Busseto, a nearby town. One night
when he was walking the three miles to go back to Busseto
after church, the poor little fellow was so weary that he
missed the road and fell into a canal, narrowly escaping
death! Is it not splendid that his village appreciated his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>talent and gave him a scholarship which made it possible
for him to go to Milan to continue his musical studies!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>His Operas</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>He did not compose an opera until 1839 when his <cite>Oberto</cite>
in the style of Bellini was produced in Milan with such
success that he received orders to write three more from
which he gained much good-will and fame.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must have been a thrilling time for opera writers,
because Wagner was composing, too, and you know the
great excitement he caused. Amidst this interesting whirl
of opinion, Verdi wrote one of the operas ordered by the
Milan director, and during this time he was sorely stricken
by the deaths of his wife and two lovely children. Besides
this, his opera failed and in his discouragement the poor
young man made up his mind to give up composition.
However, a rare good friend coaxed him back to his work
after a little rest, and he produced his successful <cite>Nebucco</cite>
(<cite>Nebuchadnezzar</cite>) (1842), <cite>I Lombardi</cite> the next year and
his well known <cite>Ernani</cite> (1844). In this, his first period,
he used as models, Bellini and men of his type, not writing
anything startlingly new.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his second period he wrote operas nearly as fast as
we write school compositions, and among the famous
things are <cite>Rigoletto</cite> (1851), <cite><span lang="it">Il Trovatore</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">La Traviata</span></cite> (story
from Dumas’ <cite>Camille</cite> or <cite><span lang="fr">Dame aux Camelias</span></cite>), (1853), and
<cite>The Masked Ball</cite> (1859). <cite>Ernani and Rigoletto</cite> are founded
on stories by Victor Hugo. The first performance of <cite><span lang="it">La
Traviata</span></cite> in Venice was a failure due more to the performers,
than to the opera itself which still crowds opera houses
of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest opera of his third period is <cite>Aida</cite> (1871),
one of Verdi’s masterpieces. An opera on an Egyptian
subject was ordered by the Khedive of Egypt for the opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>of the Italian Opera House in Cairo, for which Verdi
received $20,000. Mariette Bey a famous Egyptologist
made the first sketch in order to give the right local atmosphere
to the libretto. Curiosity ran so high that every
seat was sold before the first night and it was a great
success. Think how electrified the audience must have
been by the tenor solo, “Celeste Aida,” one of Caruso’s
greatest successes; by the realistic Nile scene; the voice of
the priestess in the mammoth Egyptian temple, and the
famous march with trumpets made specially for it!</p>

<p class='c008'>Dear old lovable Verdi was a wise man as well as an accomplished
composer. He used more modern methods in
<cite>Aida</cite> to hold audiences who were hearing about Wagner
and his startling innovations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other operas of this third period were <cite><span lang="it">La Forza del
Destino</span></cite> and one given at the Paris Grand Opera, <cite>Don Carlos</cite>,
which was not up to his standard. Until this time he
showed great mechanical skill and a sense of color and melody.
The great singers have revelled in the operas of
his second period. In our day Marcella Sembrich, Nellie
Melba, Frieda Hempel, Luisa Tetrazzini, Amelita Galli-Curci,
Florence Macbeth and many others have sung the
coloratura,—frilly, soaring, gymnastic-singing, still very
popular. However in <cite>Aida</cite>, Verdi departed much from
the usual, and people said that he was copying Wagner,
because they didn’t know the difference between the influences
which change a person’s ways, and imitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>So he deserted the old models, Auber, Meyerbeer and
Halévy for something more substantial, his deeper and
gigantically conceived <cite>Aida</cite>. James Wolfe of the Metropolitan
Opera said of the bigness of this work as produced
at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York: “I have
played before audiences of 30,000 in arenas in Mexico.
I am so at home in the opera that I do cross-word puzzles
waiting for my cue, and yet at the Metropolitan when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>first played the King in <cite>Aida</cite> with its flaming music, its
hundreds of people and its scores of horses, I was over-awed
and frightened!”</p>

<p class='c008'>After this, Verdi’s splendid mass, <cite>The Requiem</cite>, was
written for the death of the Italian hero Manzoni. In it
he approaches the German school in depth and seriousness,
veering away from the emptiness of Italian writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his last efforts he seems definitely influenced by
Wagner; for, with his <cite>Otello</cite> and <cite>Falstaff</cite> we find a new
Verdi, surpassing in form and sincere melody anything
that he had done. He was very fortunate to have Arrigo
Boito, his friend, to write librettos based on Shakespeare’s
<cite>Othello</cite> and <cite>Merry Wives of Windsor</cite>. When <cite>Falstaff</cite> was
given in New York (1925) a young American baritone,
Lawrence Tibbet, in the rôle of Ford, flashed into fame.</p>

<p class='c008'>Verdi was a man of the people, loving Italy and being
loved in return, a master of voice, ready to take good suggestions
to improve his work, always kind, high-minded,
and generous. He knew the orchestra and wrote for it in
a way that not only gave, in his last three masterpieces, a
new flavor to Italian opera, but led the way for future
composers.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Boito and His “<span lang="it">Mefistofele</span>”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Arrigo Boito (1842–1918), journalist, poet, and composer
sprang into prominence with his <cite>Mefistofele</cite>, in which
the Russian singer, Chaliapin, has attracted huge audiences
at the Metropolitan. When it was first given in
Italy, the audiences missed the coloratura arias, and the
critics were very hard on the young composer. So he went
back to journalism for many years. His next opera <cite>Nero</cite>
has a gory plot, but is real and not embroidered as were
most of the Italian operas. Boito had studied in Germany
and had absorbed much of the realism and truthfulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>that Gluck and Wagner, taught. <cite>Nero</cite> had an elaborate
first performance (1924) by the celebrated Arturo
Toscanini, one of the greatest living conductors, at <cite><span lang="it">La Scala</span></cite>
in Milan. It is a tremendous stage spectacle, surpassing in
scenic effect many of the older melodramas.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>“<span lang="it">Cavalleria Rusticana</span>” and “<span lang="it">I Pagliacci</span>”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In 1890 the first truly realistic opera was written in
Italy. A prize was offered by the publisher Sonzogno
and an unknown man, Pietro Mascagni, won it with <cite><span lang="it">Cavalleria
Rusticana</span></cite> (<cite>Rustic Chivalry</cite>). He was born in 1863,
the son of a baker. He was a musical boy, but his father
wished him to be a lawyer, so he had to work at the piano
in secret. One day when he had been locked up by his
father who did not want him to practise, he was discovered
by his uncle, who sympathized with him and took
him to Count Florestan, who helped the young musician
to study in Milan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mascagni’s work in <cite><span lang="it">Cavalleria Rusticana</span></cite> was vivid and
he used both the old and the new style of writing. It is
full of the most entrancing melody (the Intermezzo, the
Brindisi, or drinking song, and Santuzza’s aria, <cite><span lang="it">Voi lo
sapete</span></cite>). He also wrote <cite>Iris</cite> and <cite>Amico Fritz</cite>, which never
equalled <cite><span lang="it">Cavalleria</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>With Ruggiero Leoncavallo (1858–) it was different, for
only after writing a number of operas did he produce a
success in the world-famous <cite>I Pagliacci</cite>. He wrote the
tragic story of these strolling players as well as the music,
which is not as popular in style as <cite><span lang="it">Cavalleria</span></cite>, but it is
superbly put together and very dramatic. As these operas
are both short, they are often performed together. The
rôle of Canio (<cite>I Pagliacci</cite>) was one of Caruso’s masterpieces.
How wonderful to think that his voice has been
preserved for the future generations through his records of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>which <cite><span lang="it">Ridi Pagliaccio</span></cite> (<cite>Laugh Clown</cite>) is one of the finest.
It is generally admitted that Caruso’s voice was the most
glorious of our age, and certainly there was no artist more
idolized than he. In this same opera Antonio Scotti’s
performance of the famous Prologue is equally beautiful.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Giordano</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Umberto Giordano (1867) goes into peculiar realms for
subjects for his operas. He uses local political intrigues
and literature for his themes, and is known especially for
his <cite>André Chenier</cite> and <cite>Fedora</cite> which are given in many
opera houses of the world. In <cite>Siberia</cite> he uses folk songs of
Russia. He has recently set <cite>The Jest</cite> by Sem Benelli librettist
of <cite><span lang="it">L’Amore dei Tre Re</span></cite> (<cite>The Love of Three Kings</cite>) by
Italo Montemezzi.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Puccini the Popular Idol</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Now we come to a delightful opera maker, Giacomo
Puccini (1858–1924). He is the greatest modern Italian
with the exception of Verdi. He has a distinctive touch
that gives him individuality. He keeps a nice balance
between voice, orchestra and melody. His music is always
full of color and feeling. His themes, for the most part,
touch the heart and have gained wide popularity.</p>

<p class='c008'>His first opera was <cite>Manon Lescaut</cite>, the same story which
Massenet used in his delightful opera <cite>Manon</cite>; <cite><span lang="fr">La Bohème</span></cite> is
his next and is often said to be his best. It is a tale of artist
life in the Latin Quarter of Paris and is full of romance,
color, gaiety and sadness. His story is taken from Murger’s
<cite><span lang="fr">Vie de Bohème</span></cite>, which was a fortunate choice. <cite>Madame
Butterfly</cite> is another of his glittering successes. It has a
decided Japanese flavor in its musical phrases. It is based
on a story by John Luther Long, which was made into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>play by David Belasco. Butterfly was one of Geraldine
Farrar’s loveliest rôles.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite><span lang="es">Tosca</span></cite>, in which Farrar, Caruso and Scotti made a famous
trio, is a blood curdling drama of murder, cruelty and
love, full of music which mirrors the story. The libretto
was taken from Victorien Sardou’s <cite><span lang="es">La Tosca</span></cite>, a celebrated
drama in which the “divine Sarah” (Bernhardt) made one
of her most brilliant successes.</p>

<p class='c008'>He uses interesting little musical devices which make it
easy to recognize a Puccini piece, and his music has charm.
It is built on Italian tradition but is distinctly of the 19th
century. He enjoyed the greatest popularity of his day,
and there have been few, excepting perhaps Verdi and
Wagner, whose operas have been so well known. His
beautiful melody, piquant airs, fine rhythms, clever orchestration
and humanness of plot, make Puccini very often
touch the edge of <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i>. Although he uses a musical
phrase over and over again, it is not like the Wagner
<em>leit-motif</em>. There are no concerted finales or clearly
defined stopping places as there used to be in earlier
operas. So you see, Puccini profited by Wagner and
Verdi.</p>

<p class='c008'>His <cite>Girl of the Golden West</cite>, a California story of the
days of ’49, had its world première (first production) at
the Metropolitan Opera House (1910). For some time
Puccini had been looking for a libretto for a new opera.
While in New York, to be present at the Metropolitan
production of <cite>Madame Butterfly</cite>, he was also searching for
material in the hope of finding an American story. Again
David Belasco came to his aid. His own <cite>Girl of the Golden
West</cite>, a picturesque play, was being given and he invited
Puccini to see it. He was interested and turned it into
an opera. The rehearsals at the Metropolitan were most
interesting with Puccini and Belasco working together.
Emmy Destinn and Caruso sang the leading rôles.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>It is realistic, dramatic, beautiful in parts, and not written
for coloratura exhibitions! But when it was produced
it proved too Italian for Americans and too American for
the Italians, so Puccini was disappointed in its lack of
success.</p>

<p class='c008'>Puccini’s operas, as well as Verdi’s and others, have a
new popularity, that of the mechanical player audience, the
gramophone and playerpiano.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Wolf-Ferrari and “The Jewels of the Madonna”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the most delightfully witty opera writers is
Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari (1876), son of a German father and
Italian mother, and writer of <cite>The Secret of Suzanne</cite> (her
secret was that she smoked!) a very droll and amusing
story. He is musical grandchild to Mozart, so delicately
does he sketch and so charming is his melody. If you hear
his operas, including the tragic and exciting but beautiful
<cite>The Jewels of the Madonna</cite>, you will certainly say that he
can make more out of a little, than almost anyone. With
a small orchestra he seems to work miracles, and his melodies
are gracious and his rhythms captivating.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Montemezzi Visits America</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Whether it was Lucrezia Bori (Spanish soprano) or
Montemezzi who made <cite><span lang="fr">L’Amore dei Tre Re</span></cite> (<cite>The Love of
Three Kings</cite>) so entrancing, is hard to say. Here is lovely
music flowing on endlessly! It is rich and deep; the voice
is handled delightfully, and the orchestration is masterly
and beautiful throughout. <cite>The Love of Three Kings</cite> is
real music drama and few other operas have so fine a
libretto.</p>

<p class='c008'>Montemezzi with his American wife paid a visit to America
(1925) and was fittingly received at the Metropolitan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>Opera House where Edward Johnson and Lucrezia Bori
delighted people with the lovely opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the other modern names in Italy are Giovanni
Sgambati (instrumental pieces); Giuseppi Martucci (instrumental
pieces); Marco Enrico Bossi, a famous Italian
organist whose visit to this country in 1925 ended
tragically, as he died on the boat on his way home, and
Buongiorno, Eugenio di Parani and Franchetti, and Amilcare
Ponchielli (1834–1886), composer of <cite><span lang="fr">La Giaconda</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now let us turn to what France has done in opera in the
second half of the 19th century.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>French Opera</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When Meyerbeer was musical czar of Paris, we see not
only Wagner in France, but six other important composers.
Hector Berlioz (1803–1869) was a tone poet;
Charles Ambroise Thomas (1811–1896), Charles François
Gounod (1818–1893), and Georges Bizet (1838–1875) were
opera writers; Charles Camille Saint-Saëus (1835–1921)
was a composer of concertos, piano and chamber music
and of one famous opera; and César Franck the Belgian
(1822–1890) who lived in Paris, although not an opera
writer, influenced the composers of opera who lived after
him.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite>Mignon</cite> came from the heart of one of these, Ambroise
Thomas, winner of the <i><span lang="fr">Prix de Rome</span></i>, and in 1871 the
director of the Paris Conservatory. He wrote several
works, among them a successful opera <cite>Hamlet</cite>, yet none
have done as much for his reputation as <cite>Mignon</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Félicien David (1810–1876) is known for his symphonic
poem <cite><span lang="fr">Le Desert</span></cite> and his <cite>Laila Rookh</cite>, an opera which was
given at the <cite><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another well known name is Benjamin Godard (1849–1895).
Do you remember the <cite><span lang="fr">Berceuse</span></cite> from his opera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span><cite>Jocelyn</cite>? He wrote <cite><span lang="it">Le Dante</span></cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">La Vivandière</span></cite> and many
salon pieces for young students of the piano.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Gounod’s “Faust”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><cite>Faust</cite>, in connection with music, makes us think of
Gounod. Gounod was born in Paris and showed musical
ability when a boy. He was graduated from the Conservatory
and won the <i><span lang="fr">Prix de Rome</span></i> (1837).</p>

<p class='c008'>His interest always seemed to be in religious music for
he went to Italy to study Palestrina and Bach. His study
resembled a church for it had stained glass windows and
an organ, and furnishings which gave it a religious atmosphere.
After he returned from Rome he studied for the
priesthood but soon gave it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gounod’s musical training was very broad for at first
he was influenced by Rossini, Weber and Mozart, and later
by Bach and Palestrina.</p>

<p class='c008'>His <cite><span lang="fr">Messe Solennelle</span></cite> (<cite>Solemn Mass</cite>) was given in 1861
and his <cite>Faust</cite> in 1859. This is considered to be one of the
most tuneful operas written in the 19th century, and
packs opera houses all over the world. His <cite>Romeo and
Juliette</cite>, though not as popular is still given and his <cite><span lang="fr">Médecin
Malgré Lui</span></cite> (<cite>Doctor in Spite of Himself</cite>) (from Molière’s
play), “is a gem of refined setting” says Clarence Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among his other operas are <cite>Philemon and Baucis</cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">La
Reine de Saba</span></cite> (<cite>The Queen of Sheba</cite>) both inferior to <cite>Faust</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the Franco-Prussian war he lived in London
where he produced his oratorios <cite>The Redemption</cite> and <cite>Mors
et Vita</cite> (<cite>Death and Life</cite>) with his Gounod Choir, and held
in England a somewhat similar place to Handel and Mendelssohn,
for he, too, had many disciples.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a master of beautiful melody and instrumentation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>There is a new school in Paris whose slogan is, “Back to
Gounod” in order to recapture his way of writing melody!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Everybody Loves “Carmen”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In Georges Bizet we see a man of genius who produced
but one great work. To be sure he lived only thirty-seven
years, two years longer than Mozart with his hundreds of
pieces, yet Bizet is of great importance in French opera
and is looked upon by musicians as a man of rare power,
and he is loved by everyone for his marvelous <cite>Carmen</cite>.
Louis Gruenberg, the American composer, said, “I have
looked in vain for a flaw in <cite>Carmen</cite> but it is perfection
throughout. It is the one opera in the world that wins
both musicians and the masses alike, and it disarms criticism.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Emma Calvé will always be remembered as Carmen, for
she not only sang the part with its intense melody and
Spanish color, but she lived it on the stage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bizet is an amazing orchestral tone painter, and one of
the greatest of all opera writers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The story of <cite>Carmen</cite> is taken from a novel of Prosper
Mérimée and is full of the sun, the shadows, the fascinating
dances, the bull fight and the romance which belong
particularly to Spain. <cite>Carmen</cite> is an <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i>, for
in the original version as played in Paris it has spoken
dialogue.</p>

<p class='c008'>His other things full of charm are <cite>Jeux d’enfants</cite>, four-hand
pieces, the <cite>Arlesienne Suite</cite> (dances) so pictureful and
emotional. It is used as ballet sometimes for <cite>Carmen</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bizet was not appreciated and at first <cite>Carmen</cite> was a
failure, but many geniuses ahead of their time have shared
the same fate.</p>

    <div><em>French Composers of the 19th Century.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>It seems quite reasonable that after all the experiences
France has been through in the early and middle 19th
century she should now blossom out, not with remodelled
Italian opera, but with her own opera and her own ways
of writing music.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two influences were without doubt from César
Franck and Bizet whose sincerity not only influenced musicians
but rather quickly gained the public. The third
influence was of course, Wagner, who, though he infuriated
many, gained followers for his theories everywhere
that his music was heard. In France, Reyer and Chabrier
were both Wagner enthusiasts and did much to bring him
finally into the Paris Opera House a little before the 20th
century (adapted from <cite>The Art of Music</cite>). Out of these
influences came a fine group of gifted composers,—d’Indy,
Dukas, Charpentier and others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ernest Reyer (1823–1909), who was an ardent follower
of Wagner, had a hard time because of the new harmonies
he used. His last opera <cite>Salammbo</cite> is better known
to us than the others, and his works are still played in
Paris at the Grand Opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>A man famous as composer of the tone poem, <cite>España</cite>,
Emmanuel Chabrier (1841–1894) must come in here, for
at the time of his death he was writing a most interesting
opera, <cite>Briseis</cite>, which was finished by his pupils. The day
before he died Robert Louis Stevenson stopped in the
middle of a sentence, in his novel <cite>The Weir of Hermiston</cite>,
one of his best. The first woman to receive the <i><span lang="fr">Prix de
Rome</span></i> in France, Lili Boulanger (1892–1918) did much of
her composing in bed during her last illness; her devoted
sister Nadia, a prominent musician in Paris, and had
received the second <i><span lang="fr">Prix de Rome</span></i>, finished the deathbed
works. And did we not see Mozart finishing his <cite>Requiem</cite>
on the last day of his life? Illness and impending death
seem not to matter to men and women who have genius.</p>

<p class='c008'>This group was striking out for something new, and was
influenced by Wagner’s theories, Franck’s return to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>old classic style, the Russian school, the re-action against
Wagner and the renewed interest in orchestral concerts
in Paris (adapted from C. G. Hamilton).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Saint-Saëns—the Child Prodigy and Octogenarian</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Camille Saint-Saëns (1835–1921) wrote in all styles from
classic to the newest of program music. He is another
who gave concerts before he was twelve years old; he
studied at the Conservatory, lived in Paris as a composer,
organist and pianist, was a learned man and a very good
musical critic. Later in life he lived in Algiers, which
accounts for the oriental touch in his music. He journeyed
over much of the world and we heard him in Carnegie Hall,
on his last trip to this country in 1915, on his way to the
San Francisco exposition where he played the organ and
conducted his opera <cite>Samson and Delilah</cite>. He played some
of his most technically difficult pieces when he was in his
eighties. He wrote some symphonies, some descriptive
symphonic poems, <cite><span lang="fr">Le Rouet D’Omphale</span></cite>, <cite>Phæton</cite>, <cite>Dance
Macabre</cite> (very weird and rhythmic) and others. Out of
five, his G minor is the most brilliant piano concerto.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is best known for his opera <cite>Samson and Delilah</cite> which
is carried into fame by the two arias, <cite>My Heart at Thy
Sweet Voice</cite> and <cite>Love Come to My Aid</cite>. This last is of
the finest lyric writing in French opera and the first is surpassingly
emotional. The choral parts (often sounding
like early Hebrew music) show a real master at work, and
the effect of the whole is very dramatic, whether sung as
oratorio or opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not as an opera writer, however, that Saint-Saëns
wished to go down to history for he threw his whole strength
into trying to make the French public know and love the
classics. Paul Landormy says: “From the historic point
of view, Saint-Saëns is a notable figure. Saint-Saëns is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>the French Mendelssohn.... He undertook the musical
education of France at the exact moment when Berlioz
despaired of succeeding with the task, and he prepared
the public for the great French School of symphonists which
arose toward the end of the 19th century.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1871 Saint-Saëns was made president of the newly
formed National Society of Music of which you will read
later.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ballet was used to advantage by Clement Philibert
Léo Délibes (1836–1891) a master of this form of music
and dance. He built up a certain atmosphere that is particularly
French. His ballets, <cite>Coppelia</cite> and <cite>Sylvia</cite> and his
opera <cite>Lakmé</cite> are conventional and very popular. <cite>Lakmé</cite>
is <i><span lang="fr">opéra comique</span></i> because of the spoken words and of its
romantic character. Délibes always has a certain delicacy
of color, and charm which captivates.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another composer who writes in an exotic vein (or an out-of-the-nation-to-which-he-belongs
way, with all the color
of the other nation in costumes and scenes) is Edouard
Victor Antoine Lalo (1823–1892). Lalo was trained to
sincerity by his models, Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann.
This does not mean copying, for his music is not
anything like the music of these men. He skilfully drew a
variety of effects from his orchestration, and his music
has individuality. His best known work in opera is <cite>Le
Roi d’Ys</cite>. He also wrote a work for violin and orchestra
<cite><span lang="fr">Symphonie Espagnole</span></cite> which is a pet of all the violinists
because of its brilliancy and beauty.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Massenet</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Jules Massenet (1842–1912) was something like a modern
French Meyerbeer and an Offenbach combined, yet
his work is far more worth while. Before he died he was
at the height of his popularity in Europe and America,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>and the repertory of the Hammerstein Opera in New York
included many of Massenet’s works. He composed operas
so rapidly that his public could not forget him!</p>

<p class='c008'>He built on Gounod and Ambroise Thomas and gained
much from Wagner. He used continuous melody and
some of the principles of the leit-motif. Wagner’s music
compared to Massenet’s was thick for Massenet’s is thin!</p>

<p class='c008'>Whether Massenet will always remain popular is a question.
His operas are engaging and clever, and he knew how
to write theatre music to please the public. The most
important of his operas (about fifteen), are <cite>Manon</cite> and
<cite><span lang="fr">Le Jongleur de Notre Dame</span></cite>. The title parts of both were
sung by the brilliant Mary Garden, in this country. (See
Chapter VIII.) <cite>Manon</cite> ranks second to the <cite><span lang="fr">Jongleur</span></cite>.
You know, too, the Meditation from <cite>Thäis</cite>, another of
his popular successes. It was written for Sybil Sanderson,
an American singer, in Paris. Massenet’s operas did not
show his tremendous knowledge of counterpoint, of which
he was professor at the Conservatory. His position was
later filled by André Gédalge who has taught most of the
composers of today. Gédalge is also the composer of some
very fine symphonies, sonatas and an extraordinary <cite>Treatise
on the Fugue</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other writers of this period are Xavier Leroux (1863–1919),
Gabriel Pierné, born the same year, composer of a
delightful oratorio, <cite>Children’s Crusade</cite>. He is now conductor
of the Colonne Orchestra in Paris. André Messager,
born ten years before these two is the composer of some
very charming light operas of which <cite>Veronique</cite> is the best
known. There are also the great organists Charles Marie
Widor (1845) with ten organ symphonies and many other
works, and Alexandre Guilmant (1837–1911), a great organist
who came to America while one of the writers of
this book (Ethel Peyser) was at Vassar College, where
he inaugurated the new organ.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Followers of César Franck</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Although César Franck was not a successful opera writer,
he influenced composers by showing how to combine modern
harmony successfully with the classic form.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the many César Franck’s revival of the classic
style influenced are Gabriel Pierné, Henri Duparc (1848),
and Ernest Chausson (1855–1899), Franck’s pupils. Chausson
was first known through <cite>Helen</cite>, a three-act opera and
<cite><span lang="fr">Le Roi Arthus</span></cite>, which show what he might have accomplished
had not an accident caused his death. Besides
the operas he wrote beautiful chamber music, orchestral
works and songs. His <cite>Poem</cite> for violin is full of gentle, yet
deep feeling. All his work has veiled mystery and is very
lovely.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most important pupil of César Franck is Vincent
d’Indy (1851), one of the most important figures in France.
He founded, with Charles Bordes and Guilmant, the
organist, the <cite><span lang="la">Schola Cantorum</span></cite>, and revived interest in
sacred music. He has been in this country and is admired
for his symphonic works, his operas <cite>Fervaal</cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">L’Étranger</span></cite>
(<cite>The Stranger</cite>), piano pieces and chamber music. One
of his symphonic poems, <cite>Istar</cite>, was made into a ballet for
Mme. Ida Rubenstein and was performed for the first time
at the Grand Opera in Paris, in 1924.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alfred Bruneau (1857) links the Wagner period with
Debussy’s. His operas are rarely given outside of Paris.
His manner was new and caused much discussion. He
based many of his plots on Émile Zola’s writings, and
was conductor of the <cite><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></cite>. <cite>The Attack on the
Mill</cite> was given in America.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Charpentier’s “Louise”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Gustav Charpentier (1869) comes next. He made his
name with the delightful opera about the dressmaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>apprentice <cite>Louise</cite>, a musical novel on the life in Montmartre,
one of the artist quarters of Paris. Charpentier wrote the
book, which was the story of his own life. He also wrote
its sequel <cite>Julien</cite>. No one who has ever been in Paris
fails to be deeply stirred by this picture of the simple
home life of the <em>midinette</em> or sewing girl. Mary Garden
created the part of Louise in America and it was the first
rôle of her operatic career. In one scene, you hear the
almost forgotten street cries of Paris. He has also written
a charming work for orchestra, <cite>Impressions of Italy</cite>,
which is the result of his having won the <i><span lang="fr">Prix de Rome</span></i> in
his youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>This brings us up to the 20th century to which we shall
devote an entire chapter. But in order to finish our story
of French opera, we will merely introduce you to Claude
Achille Debussy, the ultra-modern harmonist and weaver
of mystery and beauty, who ushered in the 20th century
with his lovely and enchanting opera, <cite>Pelleas and Melisande</cite>
written on the play by Maurice Maeterlinck. For ten
years the composer worked over this masterpiece, and it
was produced for the first time at the <cite><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></cite>, in
Paris in 1902. Here we find something that never had
been before,—opera completely separated from all the
old ideas of what opera should be. But in tearing down
the old, Debussy gave something very rare, beautiful, sensitive,
touching a very high artistic peak, in its place. This
was pure impressionism in music, just what romanticism
was to the early 19th century. This carries the French
School to its highest degree of mystic beauty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coming later than Debussy’s opera are Maurice Ravel’s
<cite><span lang="fr">L’Heure Espagnole</span></cite> (<cite>The Spanish Hour</cite>), Henri Rabaud’s
<cite>Marouf</cite>, Paul Dukas’ <cite><span lang="fr">Ariane et Barbe Bleue</span></cite>, also a Maeterlinck
libretto and second only to <cite>Pelleas and Melisande</cite>
in atmospheric charm, Albert Roussel’s <cite>Padmavati</cite>, an
Oriental opera, that has been produced very recently at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>the Grand Opera in Paris, and Florent Schmitt’s <cite><span lang="fr">Le Petit
Elfe Ferme l’Oeil</span></cite> (<cite>The little elf winks its eye</cite>) presented at
the <cite><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></cite> in 1924.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Humperdinck—The Fairy Tale Man—Germany</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Outside of the operas of Richard Strauss, of which we
have written elsewhere, there have been few outstanding
opera writers in Germany since Wagner. Among those are
Ludwig Thuille (1861–1907), whose <cite>Lobetanz</cite> was given at
the Metropolitan Opera House in 1911; Eugene d’Albert
(1864), who has lived in Germany most of his life, although
he was born in Scotland, and wrote the lovely <cite><span lang="de">Tiefland</span></cite>
which was performed in America; Max Schillings (1868),
whose <cite>Mona Lisa</cite> was performed at the Metropolitan;
Hans Pfitzner (1869), who wrote an operatic legend based
on Palestrina; Siegfried Wagner (1869), son of Richard;
and Leo Blech (1871).</p>

<p class='c008'>The one great exception was Engelbert Humperdinck
(1854–1921), born in Bonn, Beethoven’s birthplace. He
is perhaps closer to the hearts of children than any one
else who ever wrote music. This seems much to say, but
when you hear that it was he who wrote that beautiful
little fairy story <cite>Hansel and Gretel</cite>, we are sure you will
agree. The San Carlo Opera Company has given special
performances of it in English. Would it not be nice if
operas were given in the language you best understand?
You would then find out for yourselves that this is the
story of <cite>Babes in the Woods</cite>. How fine it would have been
too, if you had been able to hear in your own language the
other opera written by Humperdinck! This was <cite>Koenigskinder</cite>
(<cite>Children of the King</cite>), which gave one of the loveliest
rôles to Geraldine Farrar, and brought a large flock of real
geese on the stage to take part in the performance. The
other name of the opera is <cite>The Goose-Girl</cite>, which explains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>the presence of the geese. Geraldine Farrar always brought
one or two with her when she acknowledged the applause
and there was always an awful squawk! In this opera
too, there is a horrid old Witch. Humperdinck found
joy and inspiration in the folk music of Germany, much of
which deals with fairies, elves, witches and inhabitants of
the world of imagination.</p>

<p class='c008'>Humperdinck was a great musician and he had the honor
of being asked to prepare the score of <cite>Parsifal</cite> for the
publishers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because of the beauties of his melodies, the lovely subjects
he selected and his sympathy with the finer and higher
things of life, it is a pity that Humperdinck left so few works.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was attracted to the theatre and wrote much music
as theatre music for plays. This is called incidental music,
that is, it is incidental and the play’s the thing! Just
before he died Humperdinck wrote the incidental music
for the <cite>Miracle</cite> which is a great spectacle in pantomime.
This means that there is no speaking, only tableaux and
acting. He did not live to finish it, but it was completed
by his son, for the production made by Max Reinhardt.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVII<br> <span class='c016'>Some Tone Poets</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Probably you think that any music on a program
is program music! Of course it is, but not in the special
use of the word, for when it is program music, it has a
story of its own and has to be described in more or less
detail so that the audience can understand what it is about.
Therefore, we find two classes of music—<em>absolute music</em>,
which needs no story to explain it, and—<em>program music</em>,
which does. Beethoven’s best works are known by their
opus number while most of Schumann’s have descriptive
titles. Early composers sometimes wrote music describing
or imitating something, like Daquin’s <cite>Cuckoo</cite>, Jannequin’s
<cite>Battle of Marignan</cite>, <cite>The Carman’s Whistle</cite>, etc. These
pieces were program music in a way, but the modern tone
poets went further by writing music with rather extended
stories and with music not as simple as it used to be, but
nevertheless an outgrowth of ballad form, sonata and the
symphony.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suppose you wanted to write a tone poem! First you
must have a subject and then you must write music to
explain it. Let us say you were going to write a Subway
Tone Poem, your program notes might read something
like this: The hero rushes away from his office, into the
hurrying, scurrying street, down the slippery, crowded
subway steps, and when he reaches the noisy turnstile
slips in his fare and meets his young lady. He leads her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>through the crowd, protecting her from the jostling mob.
Then they enter the train and above the noise and bustle
they cast sweet glances at each other and converse. The
train stops occasionally and finally they get off at their
station. They walk to her home, along an empty side street
where it is quiet and charming. He doffs his cap and we
leave them, both thinking lovely things about each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Don’t you think you’re ready now to write a tone poem?</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Berlioz, Innovator</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Up to Hector Berlioz’ time (1803–1869), there was no
definite attempt to write a tone poem with an elaborate
story. This man, one of the most complicated in musical
history, did much to help music and future musicians,
for he started to tell stories in music without scenery or
dialogues.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was born near Lyons, France, the son of a doctor
who wanted him to study medicine, but as he almost
fainted several times in the dissecting room, he gave it up.
This was his first rebellion and all his life he struggled
against nearly everything that existed. His was a noble
discontent in many ways, for he believed deeply in his own
ideas and suffered much putting them into practice. He
lived shortly after the French Revolution when everything
was topsy-turvy. Many of the old things that people had
looked upon with reverence had vanished and he tried, as
other young men of his day, to forge new ideas according to
his sense of right.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day he saw some musical score paper and realized
in a moment, what wonderful things might be done with
it and exclaimed: “What an orchestral work one might
write on that!” and quite suddenly, he decided to write
music! He could only play the guitar, the flute and the
flageolet and knew practically nothing of harmony. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>certainly paid well for his decision, for he had a hard
struggle with himself and circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took one of his compositions to Professor Lesueur
at the Paris Conservatory, and was admitted.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="la">Berlioz Versus Cherubini</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Cherubini, Director of the Conservatory, made a rule
that men and women should use separate doors leading into
the library. Not knowing this rule, Berlioz entered by
the door reserved for the women and sat down to read a
score of his beloved Gluck. Cherubini, thin, pale-faced,
with tousled hair and fiercely shining eyes, came up to Hector
and reprimanded him for breaking the rule. They had
a noisy fight, chasing in and out among the desks and
when Berlioz reached the door, he looked back at Cherubini
and called out: “I am soon coming back to study
Gluck again.” Being a determined boy, he did come
back, but Cherubini, on whom his future depended, was
his staunch enemy for life.</p>

<p class='c008'>His parents were infuriated with Hector for his conduct
in and out of school. His mother, a pious woman, practically
disowned him and his father gave him but a small
allowance with the stipulation that unless he could soon
prove his ability in music, he should have to go back to
medicine. So he tried desperately to earn money, by singing
in choruses, playing the flute and teaching, hoping that
he could win the <i><span lang="fr">Prix de Rome</span></i>, which would give him a few
years in Rome and three thousand francs. After terrific
opposition by Cherubini and held back, too, by his own lack
of diplomacy, either by submitting works that were written
too poorly or too well, he lost many chances for the
prize and finally, after four attempts, he won the coveted
award with his cantata <cite>Sardanapalus</cite>. The amusing thing
about this is, that he left out the parts then looked upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>as modern, and difficult, which would have lost him the
prize, but the first time it was played in public, he put
them all in, and the piece was successful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he fell in love, and after much posing and strutting
about and foolish behavior, he married the young Irish
actress, Harriet Smithson. They were very unhappy and
unfortunate, but he was good to her and even gave up
composing to earn a living by writing, and he proved an
exceptionally gifted writer and critic.</p>

<p class='c008'>His autobiography, too, is most interesting for he sees
himself as a romantic hero and tells the tale with great
dramatic energy and exaggeration.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>With Intent to Murder!</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>At one time he was engaged to another woman who was
unkind to him and he wrote: “Two tears of rage started
from my eyes and my mind was made up on the spot to
kill without mercy.” But being impetuous and quick tempered,
he never reached the scene of murder, for, when
about to sail to where she was, he either fell or jumped
into the water, which very much dampened his ardor for
killing.</p>

<p class='c008'>One night, Chopin and Schumann followed him because
he had threatened to kill himself. But, at the crucial
moment Berlioz changed his mind!</p>

<p class='c008'>Life for Berlioz was a drama in which he was the leading
man, and he watched his own performance, as if he
were a part of the audience. He craved novelty at every
turn. He was sensitive, high-strung and vain, and yet withal,
he had the dignity of being loyal to his beliefs in himself,
and did not want to deceive anybody. He wrote
with humor, brilliancy and understanding, he had faith
in his work, and was sufficiently heroic to stick to his
course whatever the cost. He was a martyr, for he suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>in order to do what he wished in music, and was never
appreciated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although he went to England, Germany, Austria and
Russia, and was very successful, Paris, only, interested
him. In 1863, his opera <cite>The Trojans in Carthage</cite> failed
and in 1868, he died, a broken-hearted man.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Berlioz’s Contribution to Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>It seems strange, but Berlioz disliked Bach and Palestrina
and worshiped Beethoven, Gluck and Weber. He
was jealous of Wagner and did everything he could to
make <cite>Tannhäuser</cite> a failure in Paris.</p>

<p class='c008'>Berlioz invented new ways, as do our Jazz Bands today,
to make the instruments produce different sounds. He
put bags over the horns, hung up the cymbals and had them
struck with sticks instead of clapping them together,
dressed up the drumsticks in sponges, and was much
pleased at the effect made when a trombone played a
duet with a piccolo. He made propaganda for new instruments
especially for the horn, invented by Adolphe Saxe,
which was called Sax Horn, and from which descended the
Saxophone, so behold Berlioz, the founder of the Jazz
Band!</p>

<p class='c008'>Where other composers would use four trombones or
one, he used sixteen! In his <cite>Requiem</cite> for example, he used
sixteen trombones, twelve ophicleides (cornets with extra
levers or keys), eight pairs of kettle drums, two bass drums,
a gong and of course, all the regular string and reed instruments.
He boasted after the first performance, that a
man had a fit from the excessive noise!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Intimate Friend of Instruments</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>He wrote the sort of melody that showed off each particular
instrument to its best advantage. He studied them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>as if they were human beings, and he understood their
characters and temperaments, what they could do and at
what they would balk. He showed the possibilities of the
choirs of wood wind instruments, a rich heritage for
us today. The orchestra playing a piece of his, directed
by him was matchless in its effect. <cite>Effect</cite> was the keynote
of his writings. As the first great master of tonal
effect, he is unsurpassed, and his book on orchestration
is still one of the most practical text books on the
subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Berlioz used the <i><span lang="fr">idée fixe</span></i> (fixed idea) or <em>leit-motif</em>, not as
Wagner used it later, but quite definitely, twisting a
theme in many ways to bring out different phases of the
same subject. Thus, Berlioz founded the dramatic in music,
without scenery and without words, which is the Symphonic
Tone Poem.</p>

<p class='c008'>The majority of the people did not understand him any
more than they understand Stravinsky today. His greatest
work was his <cite>Symphony Fantastic</cite> written in 1829, in
which he used the <i><span lang="fr">idée fixe</span></i> to tell about the life of the
artist, in true program music style for which he fought
and almost bled. In <cite>Harold in Italy</cite>, he makes a departure
by giving to the viola, the rôle of the “leading lady” which
had not been done up to his day. He often used voices
with the orchestra as he did in his tone poems <cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>, and <cite>The Damnation of Faust</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The noisy <cite>Requiem</cite> is one of the finest things he did, and
his overtures, the best of which is the <cite><span lang="it">Benvenuto Cellini</span></cite>,
are fine works. The oratorio, <cite>The Infancy of Christ</cite>, written
in classic style, was well received, but his operas never
succeeded.</p>

<p class='c008'>He paved the way for new orchestral effects and prepared
the ground for Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Richard
Strauss, and all the other orchestral composers. He was
a musical Byron, for he was more interesting than beautiful,
more vivid than noble, a sincere <em>poseur</em>, faithful to
his ideas and always searching for romance.</p>

in his pocket, and loved and admired Shakespeare, Goethe,
Byron, Walter Scott and other great writers on whose
works he based many compositions. In his fascinating
autobiography, he said, “The dominant qualities of my
music are passionate expression, internal fire, rhythmic
animation and unexpected change,” and he was right.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so we leave this romantic man, craving sensation
in his life and in his music, exaggerated in word and tone,
and thank him for what Daniel Gregory Mason calls, “His
contribution to the unresting progress of art.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was not appreciated in Paris until after his death, and
some one said that the stones hurled at him in contempt
were soon piled up for him in the pedestals of his monuments.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Franz Liszt</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Another Mozart seems about to appear, for Franz Liszt
(1811–1886), too, was an infant prodigy!</p>

<p class='c008'>He was born in Raiding, Hungary, and his father,
Adam Liszt, who was steward to Prince Esterhazy, gave
Franz piano lessons and managed his first concert tours.</p>

<p class='c008'>At nine Liszt played in public, then went to Vienna and
took lessons from Carl Czerny and Salieri. When twelve
years old he played in Paris and “set the world on fire”
with his brilliancy. Some one said that after his first concert
that he had a triumphal progress to fame over the laps
of great ladies, for he was petted and “bon-bonned” and
kissed by all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liszt wanted to go to the Conservatory in Paris, but
as he was a foreigner, Cherubini, though a foreigner himself,
would not admit him.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Advertising Liszt</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Here is a handbill used for advertising the little boy
Liszt:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c030'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>An Air</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c031'>With grand Variations by Herz, will be performed
on Erard’s New Patent-Grand Pianoforte, by:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c030'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Master Liszt</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c031'>Who will likewise perform an Extempore Fantasia
and respectfully requests two written Themes
from any of the Audience upon which he will play
his Variations</p>

<p class='c008'>This illustrates two interesting things. The first, the
mention of the <em>grand pianoforte</em>, which had not been in
use very long; the second, the fashion in Liszt’s day of
improvising before an audience, a “stunt” almost like
solving a cross-word puzzle without a dictionary!</p>

<p class='c008'>For a long time, he was advertised as two years younger
than he was, and his father carried him to the piano; but
he soon rebelled at this pretense and it was discontinued.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Liszt Shows His Unselfishness</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>After Liszt’s father died in 1827, he gave up concert
tours for a while, and settled down with his mother for
eight restful years to study and teach the piano. Liszt
generously gave his mother all the money he had made in
his successful tours because, he said, she had made so
many sacrifices for him. At this time he grew spiritually
deeper and well fitted for the glories to come. Like Berlioz,
Liszt was born a short time after the French Revolution,
when new ideas were coming into literature, religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>and art, through which this young and gifted artist
tried to guide himself in a wholesome way that shaped
his future life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liszt again made concert tours through Europe (1839),
and astounded everyone with his playing and the charm of
his personality. Musicians and audiences were at his
feet! He made a great deal of money, too, and grew so
popular that artists painted him, ladies knelt before him in
adoration, tableaux were given in his honor, monuments
erected to him and societies named after him.</p>

<p class='c008'>His kindness to the poor and needy was unfailing. When
Pesth was inundated by a flood, he sent a generous gift
to the sufferers; he established a fund for the poor in
Raiding and completed the necessary sum for the Beethoven
monument at Bonn. He never accepted money
for teaching after he was “grown up” for he wanted to be
a help to his some three hundred pupils. It is said that
after 1847 he never gave a concert for his own benefit!
An extraordinary character!</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1843, he went to Weimar, as a visiting artist. Soon
he met Princess Von Sayn Wittgenstein of Russia who realized
his great gifts and influenced him to become more
than a pianist. Later in the year we see him as Choir
Master living at Weimar and attracting the greatest people
of the musical world to him. Here Liszt was able to help
young musicians who came from all over the world. Wagner
would never have been so successful, had not Liszt
aided him during his exile. He stood by him with patience
and loving kindness and helped him to produce his operas.
He was of untold assistance to Schumann and Berlioz,
Rubinstein, Cornelius and countless others by performing
their works when nobody else dared to. Liszt was in high
favor with society, and having a love for the new in music,
he used his popularity to help music grow. Wagner himself
said: “At the end of my last stay in Paris, when ill,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>broken down and despairing, I sat brooding over my fate,
my eye fell on the score of my <cite>Lohengrin</cite>, totally forgotten
by me. Suddenly I felt something like compassion that
this music should never sound from off the death-pale
paper. I wrote two lines to Liszt; his answer was the news
that preparations for the performance were being made on
the largest scale the limited means of Weimar would permit.”
Liszt’s motto was, “First Place to the Living.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Liszt’s Professional Life</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Liszt’s services were demanded for concerts and festivals
in many towns from 1852–1859. The people, however,
could not understand how their idol could believe in
Wagner and Berlioz, and there were many rabid discussions.
Very soon Liszt brought out his own symphonic
poems, <cite><span lang="it">Tasso</span></cite>, <cite>Prometheus</cite>, <cite>Mazeppa</cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">Les Preludes</span></cite>, and his
two piano concertos (1855–1857), utilizing his romantic
ideas.</p>

<p class='c008'>After leaving Weimar, which some biographers claim was
because of the adverse criticism of Cornelius’ opera, <cite>The
Barber of Bagdad</cite>, Liszt went to Rome. Here his deep
mystical nature and his need for rest and time for contemplation,
led him to enter one of the Holy Orders of the
Church, and the Pope gave him the honorary title of
Abbé. Pope Pius IX adored him and called him his Palestrina.
The church music which he composed there
included his oratorios <cite>St. Elizabeth</cite>, <cite>The Christus</cite>, his unfinished
<cite>Stanislaus</cite>, the <cite>Hungarian Coronation Mass</cite> and the
<cite>Requiem</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liszt returned to Weimar every spring and summer and
conducted many festivals and concerts, including the
Beethoven centenary. He was also much interested in the
National Academy at Pesth, so now he divided his time
between Rome, Pesth, and Weimar.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>He wrote many brilliant piano pieces, among them his
nineteen remarkable Hungarian Rhapsodies based on the
melodies he heard from the gypsies. Besides composing
music, teaching and helping other musicians and giving to
the needy, he wrote essays and criticisms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In appearance Liszt was tall and thin with deep-set eyes
and bushy eyebrows and a mouth which turned up at the
corners when he smiled. His charm of manner won all
who came in contact with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>A story is told of him that he as a youth was sitting to
the artist Scheffer for his portrait, and fell into a theatrical
pose, probably with his head thrown back and one hand
thrust into the breast of his buttoned coat, which was
characteristic. As this did not impress the painter, Liszt,
realizing it, cried with much embarrassment, “Forgive,
dear master, but you do not know how it spoils one to have
been an infant prodigy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of Liszt’s outward affectation and posing, he
had a noble character. He was simple and whole-souled,
free from jealousy and the love of money. He died highly
honored in 1886 at the age of seventy-five at a Wagner
festival in Bayreuth. In fact it was difficult to tell who
received more honor at Bayreuth, Liszt in the audience or
Wagner at the conductor’s desk.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Liszt’s Accomplishments</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>As a pianist, no one has surpassed Liszt and he revealed
the piano’s possibilities. In addition to his pianoforte
compositions, he made “arrangements” of symphonies,
chorals, operas, songs and every other form, which brought
them closer to the people. His arrangements are so brilliant,
although over-decorated and cheap in effect, that he
shows that the piano can almost reproduce the orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liszt was not as great a composer as he was a pianist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>and stimulator of other musicians, and much of his music
was written for effect. Yet he was a great critic and his
love of music for the future rather than of the past, led him
to be sympathetic with young composers, for whom he
opened the way. The people who gathered about him disliked
old forms and were looking for new music in which
he encouraged them. Among the musicians who were
friends and pupils at Weimar, were: Joseph Joachim Raff,
Peter Cornelius, Eduard Lassen, who took Liszt’s place
when he left Weimar, Leopold Damrosch, the father of
Walter and Frank Damrosch of New York, Alexander
Ritter, the pianist and inspirer of so many great people,
and hundreds of others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liszt wrote many symphonic and choral pieces which
showed marked originality. Although not as profound as
Wagner, he helped Wagner so much that their names
would be forever linked, even if his daughter Cosima had
not been Wagner’s wife.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Rubinstein and Von Bülow</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Among other friends of Liszt of value to musical history
were Anton Rubinstein (1829–1894) (page <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>), the
Russian, and Hans von Bülow (1830–1894), a German.
Both these men were great pianists and wrote noteworthy
compositions. Liszt was a great stimulus to them and
they had many points in common. Rubinstein was romantic
and von Bülow, classic. Rubinstein did much to
link Germany and Russia musically, which was a help to
both nations. Von Bülow was an illustrious pianist,
friend of Wagner, famous conductor, and editor of many
musical scores, among them an edition of Beethoven’s
Sonatas, still in constant use. Both these men did much
for pianists all over Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other great pianists and composers of their day were:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>Nikolai Rubinstein (Anton’s brother) (1835–1881); Theodor
Leschetizky (1830–1915), trained by Carl Czerny, and
he in turn trained hundreds of pianists; Karl Tausig and
many others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, the effect of these pianists was to make music
and the piano more popular, thus adding greatly to the
musical culture of the world.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tchaikovsky</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>You probably know of Piotr (Peter) Ilyitch Tchaikovsky
(1840–1893) as a great symphony writer, but he was also
a successful writer of tone poems such as <cite>The Tempest</cite>,
<cite>Francesco di Rimini</cite>, <cite>Manfred</cite>, based on Byron’s <cite>Manfred</cite>,
<cite>Hamlet</cite>, <cite>The Storm</cite>, <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> and two incomplete
poems, <cite>Destiny</cite> and <cite>Voievoda</cite>. Tchaikovsky was born in
Russia, he went to the school of Jurisprudence and later
entered the Ministry of Justice but soon began to compose
music and took a medal for composition for a piece
which he wrote on Schiller’s <cite>Ode to Joy</cite>, the poem Beethoven
used in his 9th Symphony. He also wrote <cite>The Nut Cracker</cite>
Suite for orchestra, adapted from the score of a Ballet,
which includes a Russian dance, an Arab dance, a Chinese
dance, flower waltz, and other fascinating, whirling, delightful
dances.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of Tchaikovsky’s things not called tone poems
have very definite programs, such as <cite>The Snow Maiden</cite>
(<cite>Snegovrotchka</cite>) a favorite legend and music to a fairy tale—the
parts are named <cite>Chorus of Blind Gusslee Players</cite>, <cite>Monologue
of the Frosts</cite>, <cite>Appearance of the Wood Demons</cite> and
so on.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sergei Rachmaninov</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Boecklin’s painting <cite>Isle of Death</cite>, inspired Sergei Rachmaninov
(1873) to write a most beautiful musical poem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>about its sombre trees and the sea. As a distinguished
pianist he has glorified the art in all countries, especially
in America. He was a student of Siloti and of Zvierev, a
friend of Tchaikovsky. His masters in harmony and theory
were Taneiev and Arensky. He has held musical posts
of honor and has written remarkable piano concertos,
chamber music works, choruses and one opera, <cite>Aleko</cite>.
You probably know his much played C minor Prelude
which has been a sort of visiting card of Rachmaninov to
the public.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Richard Strauss, the Proteus of Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In the list of tone poets, Richard Strauss (1864), or
Richard II is one of the most important. It is strange that
he should have the same name as Wagner, for his father
Franz Strauss, a skilled horn player, disliked Wagner and
his compositions intensely. Richard’s mother was the
daughter of a brewer and they all lived in Munich, where
the son was born.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he was a little boy, he wrote musical notes before
he could write the alphabet, and at six, composed little
pieces. By the time he was twenty he had written compositions
which put him with Schubert and Mozart, in the
ranks of musical prodigies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Until his sixteenth work <cite><span lang="de">Aus Italien</span></cite> (<cite>From Italy</cite>) (1886),
his first tone poem, he did not depart from the classic forms,
although there were a few signs of change in style in a violin
sonata which he wrote just before the tone poem. In
fact, he was so much against Wagner and his innovations,
that no one could have guessed that later he himself would
be considered an innovator and would be accused of imitating
Wagner.</p>

<p class='c008'>During his youth, after hearing <cite>Siegfried</cite> he wrote to a
friend about the music of Mime: “It would have killed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>a cat and the horror of musical dissonances would melt
rocks into omelettes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When he met von Bülow, the old master thought little
of his talents, but the young man gave him a surprise. For,
when Richard went to Meiningen he had never led an
orchestra in his life and without one rehearsal, conducted
his <cite>Serenade for Strings</cite>, opus 7. Von Bülow realized his
great ability, made him assistant conductor, and a year
later when he left Meiningen, Strauss took his place.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was about now that Richard met Alexander Ritter the
violinist and radical thinker who, he said, changed his life
by introducing to him new ideas. He became converted
to Wagner. When he heard <cite>Tristan and Isolde</cite> he was
thrilled by it. So, like Proteus, the god who changed his
form to suit his adventure, Strauss, the musical Proteus
changed his ideas to suit his opinions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wearied by hard work after writing many classical pieces
including a sonata, an overture, the <cite><span lang="de">Festmarsch</span></cite>, a violin
concerto, songs, a horn concerto and other things, he became
very ill. He said to a friend that he was ready to die, and
then added, “No, before I do, I should love to conduct
<cite>Tristan</cite>.” This shows that the young man could change
his opinion and become devoted to what he loathed years
before, a fine quality which continually brought down
upon his head criticism from smaller folk. Yet this Proteus-like
quality was a sign of his power for growth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because he did not gain strength quickly from his illness,
he went to Italy and then wrote his first symphonic
poem <cite><span lang="de">Aus Italien</span></cite> (<cite>From Italy</cite>) in a new and modern vein.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he returned, he led the orchestra in the Court
Theatre of Munich and then went to Weimar for two
years, and this former young classicist was now hailed as
the leader of modern composers! He produced, here, three
tone poems: <cite>Macbeth</cite>, <cite>Don Juan</cite> and <cite><span lang="de">Tod und Verklärung</span></cite>
(<cite>Death and Transfiguration</cite>) (1888–1890).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>Then, on account of illness (1892) he went to Greece,
Egypt and Sicily. During this tour, he wrote <cite>Guntram</cite>,
which he produced on his return to Weimar.</p>

<p class='c008'>He became interested in the Bayreuth festivals and in
1894 he conducted a production of <cite>Tannhäuser</cite>, after
which he married Pauline de Ana who played Elizabeth.
Before this, he had made her the heroine of his first opera,
<cite>Guntram</cite> (1893).</p>

<p class='c008'>Not long after this he gave up the Weimar post and
went to Munich with his bride. He became the conductor
there and at the same time, led the Berlin Philharmonic
concerts until the double work and commuting became
too much for him. He gave up Berlin and Arthur Nikisch
succeeded him,—the same Arthur Nikisch who later took
the baton of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in America.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1899 he became the leader of the Royal Opera in Berlin
in which city he decided to live and from there made
trips all over the world including the United States, first
in 1904 and later, after the World War. During his last
tour, we heard him play the piano for his songs which are
unsurpassed in beauty, and conduct some of his own
orchestral works with skill and enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is tall and slender, with kindly blue eyes, rather
informal in manner. He has the air of a happy man even
if he has received some of the harshest criticism from
friends and foes that any composer has had from earliest
times. His wife used to sing his songs in public. He is
fond of games, especially the card game “skat” and like
the true grandson of a brewer enjoys his glass of beer.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Strauss’s Contribution to Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Among Strauss’ greatest works are his operas <cite>Electra</cite>,
<cite>Salome</cite> and <cite><span lang="de">Der Rosenkavalier</span></cite> and his nine tone poems.
Despite all the harsh things critics have said of him, Strauss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>has always maintained that, although he did not write in
accepted forms, he felt that the form should always be
suitable to the subject, for “as moods and ideas change
so must forms.” This, Ernest Newman said in defence of
Strauss, and it may be applied to all arts.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Strauss is not formless but like Proteus, has many
forms. Cecil Gray said, “he seems to have an irresistible
itch to provoke the amazement and the horror of the
multitude.” This is quite true, especially in <cite>Salome</cite>,
<cite>Electra</cite> and <cite><span lang="de">Der Rosenkavalier</span></cite> in which opera he went back
to Mozart form as a model. It seems incredible that a
man who could write the noble songs that he has written
should have chosen such unpleasant plots for his operas!</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite><span lang="de">Tod und Verklärung</span></cite> (<cite>Death and Transfiguration</cite>) he
was distinctly a follower of Liszt. His friend Alexander
Ritter is said to have written the poem after the music.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the time that it was first played, it caused so much
comment that Strauss, like Browning, laughed at people
for trying to “read” more into it than he wrote. Browning
was asked whether he meant a certain thing in one of
his poems, and his reply was something like this: “Madam,
I never thought of it, but if you think it is there, I am more
than glad to know it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His <cite>Don Juan</cite> is delightful, too, but his <cite>Til Eulenspiegel</cite>
(1895) which tells of the mischievous pranks of Til, is one
of the finest examples of <em>humor</em> in music and probably will
outlive many works of this modern period, his own as well
as others. He wrote it in the form of a classical Rondo,
because he could picture Til’s ever recurring deviltry and
exploits in this form. Poor Strauss was reviled for this
daringly written music, too, yet this tone poem is an amazing
piece of work and was given gloriously as a ballet in
New York City a few years ago by Diaghilev’s Russian
Ballet.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite><span lang="de">Also Sprach Zarathustra</span></cite> (<cite>Thus Spake Zarathustra</cite>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>Strauss uses the <i><span lang="fr">idée fixe</span></i> or <em>leit-motif</em>. This is based on a
prose poem of Nietzsche.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite>Don Quixote</cite> he goes back to the form of the classical
variation, for it is an ingenious way of showing the varying
sides of the character of Don Quixote. Here he shows
events and not ideas, a most definite story in tones. You
can almost see the attack on the wind-mills and you can
actually hear the sheep bleating, the church music of passing
pilgrims, and the love tale of Dulcinea. In this piece,
program music reaches its height.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite><span lang="de">Ein Heldenleben</span></cite> (<cite>A Hero’s Life</cite>) (1898) Strauss frankly
quotes from his musical works. He does not have to prove
that he is the hero, for he admits it! When Strauss was
asked what the poem meant, he said, “There is no need
of a program, it is enough to know that there is a hero
fighting his enemies.” In it, you can really hear the carping
critics, his retorts, the triumphs and the defeats. It
is very interesting and amazingly well written.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <cite>Domestic Symphony</cite> (<cite><span lang="it">Sinfonia Domestica</span></cite>) is the
story of a family for one day. There is the father motif,
the mother motif and the baby motif! The final fugue
represents education very aptly for you get from it the
sense of flight and struggle and the never endingness of
education.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of his last works is <cite>The Alpine Symphony</cite>. His
other works include an early opera <cite><span lang="de">Feuersnoth</span></cite>, and his songs
which are among the greatest ever written by any composer,
ranking him with Franz, Schubert, Schumann,
Brahms and Hugo Wolf.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strauss shows in all his work great pictorial power. He
paints in tones if ever a man does. His humor in music is
amazing. He tries to make vivid in music a thing as simple
as a fork and as complex as a philosophic idea. Some one
said of him, comparing him to Wagner, that he started out
to write symphonic poems and really wrote music dramas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>while Wagner started out to write music dramas and
ended by writing <cite>Tristan and Isolde</cite>, a super-symphonic
poem with voices added.</p>

<p class='c008'>Richard Strauss is the last of the great German classic
and romantic composers who have ruled the musical
world for the past two centuries. Still living in Germany
he has opened the way to many of the younger composers,
who have learned much from his methods of orchestration
and handling music in the large forms. While he out-Wagnered
Wagner in strange and new harmony, he now
seems old fashioned in comparison to Schoenberg, Stravinsky
and Honegger. Although Strauss seemed to us
very complex and exaggerated a few years ago, it was very
interesting to notice that when his works were revived in
America after the War, the audiences had grown up
musically to the point where they seemed no longer unintelligible
or ultra-modern.</p>

<p class='c008'>We remember when we were leaving the opera house
after the first performance of <cite>Salome</cite> in this country, hearing
one ill bred, untutored woman say, “Gee! Goit, but
that was one big noise!” By this time she has probably
reached the point where she is jazzing the Salome dance
with real pleasure and understanding!</p>

<p class='c008'>He did many unusual things with instruments, added
many new ones, and as someone said, he loves to have the
“trombone play like a piccolo!”</p>

<p class='c008'>No one can say where Strauss will stand as a composer,
for time alone can place him. However, we make bold to
state that he will stand high in the company of the world’s
composers.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Chabrier</span> (1841–1894)</h4>

<p class='c018'>As imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, there is
no proof of the success of the tone poem more telling than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>the fact that practically every composer in the musical
world has written symphonic tone poems. In fact today,
one hundred tone poems are written to one symphony!
Berlioz had his followers in France, and in the group around
César Franck were several who wrote tone poems. One
of the most charming of these poets was Alexis Emanuel
Chabrier (1841–1894) who took up music first as an amateur
while studying law in Paris, and while he was Minister
of the Interior. Later he became so devoted to music
that he gave all his time to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among his works are operas and many other forms of
music, the loveliest of which is the Rhapsody on Spanish
tunes called <cite>España</cite>. It is a model of its kind and in it
he uses the collected material with rare skill. It shows
him very clever in reproducing foreign atmosphere and
feeling. He was born in Ambert, France, and died in
Paris.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Debussy</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Claude Achille Debussy (1862–1918) although talked of
in another chapter, must be mentioned as a composer of
tone poems in this. Among his most famous works are
<cite><span lang="fr">Après-midi d’Un Faune</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">La Mer</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">Les Nuages</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">Fêtes</span></cite>, and
<cite><span lang="fr">Sirènes</span></cite> which are all surpassingly lovely, written in Debussy’s
special harmonies with which he wove a mystical,
far away atmosphere, so compelling and yet so magical
that you think you are in a mysterious cloudland. He
usually uses a scale of whole tones. In <cite>Pelleas and Melisande</cite>,
his greatest work (opera) you seem to look into a distant
land which never did and never will exist, except in
the glorious reaches of his or our imaginations. So to those
of us who love fairy realms, cloudland and beauty of idea
and serene expression, Debussy will be a rare treat and never
vanish from our mind’s ear.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ravel</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Maurice Ravel (1875) still living in Paris, seems to love
Spanish themes as did Chabrier and Bizet. One of
the loveliest tone poems is his <cite><span lang="fr">Rhapsodie Espagnole</span></cite> in
four movements. His <cite>Mother Goose</cite> suite and <cite><span lang="fr">La Valse</span></cite>
are also lovely, modern, short orchestral works.</p>

<p class='c008'>He writes with rare distinction and beauty. In the chapter
on 20th century music, Ravel will make another appearance.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Paul Dukas</span> (1865)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Among the most humorous and delightful tone poems is
<cite><span lang="fr">L’Apprenti-Sorcier</span></cite> (<cite>The Sorcerer’s Apprentice</cite>) by Paul
Dukas (1865). Dukas too, will appear in another chapter.</p>

<h4 class='c027'><span class='sc'>Brahms in Germany—Franck in France</span></h4>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c029'>After calling Beethoven a Colossus, there does not
seem to be room for any one else, and yet Brahms
(1833–1897) is no less of a genius. You will often hear
people speak of “the three Bs,”—Bach, Beethoven and
Brahms; and of these, Brahms being closer to our own
day has had the advantage and influence of the past. But
perhaps he also had the disadvantage of having had some
one else say what he would like to have been the first to
say! That Brahms continued the things that Beethoven
began, may be understood from the fact that many call
Brahms’ first symphony <cite>The Tenth</cite>, meaning that Brahms
had begun his symphonies where Beethoven left off.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>It is not easy to write of Brahms without seeming to
exaggerate, because if we speak of his songs we must say
that no one ever created more beautiful song form; if we
speak of his chamber music we must acknowledge that he
understood writing for instruments as no one before or
since has surpassed. His piano pieces, too, are pure delight!
Where will one find finer work than his one concerto for
violin and those for piano? His four symphonies have so
far been unsurpassable and his choral works, too. If he
had never written anything but the <cite>German Requiem</cite> this
would have marked him as one of the world’s masters.
Has he not justified Schumann’s exclamation upon meeting
him in 1853, when Brahms was twenty years old? “Graces
and Heroes have watched the cradle of this young genius
who sprang ‘like Minerva, fully armed from the head of
Jove.’” But Brahms was very modest and was always
embarrassed in the presence of praise. While he was
compared to Beethoven he waited until very late in life
to write symphonies. “How can I write a symphony,”
he is reported to have said, “when I feel the shadow of
the great Beethoven treading constantly behind me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was born in Hamburg. His father, who was a musician,
rejoiced greatly when little Johannes at an early age
gave proof that he was gifted. The Brahms family was
very poor, and instead of becoming a great artist according
to his desire, Johannes’ father from the time he was
old enough to earn his living, was a double-bass player.
Even though he was the best in Hamburg, he and his wife,
who was also musical, had to struggle and save to give
their little son the best teachers in piano and composition.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to make more than the small amount gained by
playing in the orchestras the father organized what we
call “the little German band” which played in the open
air. Father Brahms and five other musicians attracted
the people wherever they went. The boy who had begun
to earn a few pennies by arranging dances and marches for
the little bands of the cafés, wrote music for his father’s
band, and early in the morning even while he brushed
shoes before others were awake, the thoughts which became
his loveliest songs came to his mind.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Brahms meets Remenyi</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When Johannes was fifteen he gave his first public piano
recital and made a deep impression. It started him on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>the road to fame, for he played so well that he was engaged
to accompany the Gypsy violinist, Remenyi, who played
all over the world and became very famous. Brahms went
into many countries with him but never came to America,
where Remenyi was a great idol. Gypsy-like, he was happy
in his wanderings and when he was old went into vaudeville,
drawing thousands wherever he played. He was
about to face one of these immense audiences in San Francisco
but drew only a few tones from his beloved violin
when his magic fingers were stilled in death!</p>

<p class='c008'>Remenyi was a great influence in Brahms’ life, for it was
through him that Brahms became fascinated with the
Gypsy Dances which the composer gave the world as
<cite>Hungarian Dances</cite>. He wrote them for piano solos, duets
and bits of them may be found all through Brahms’ orchestral
writings. This is folk music, even though it was not
the folk music of the country in which Brahms was born.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another important thing that came into his life through
Remenyi was his meeting with Joachim, one of the greatest
violinists and teachers of the world. At a concert
given by Remenyi when playing the <cite>Kreutzer</cite> sonata of
Beethoven the piano was tuned so low that Brahms was
compelled to transpose the entire piano part a semitone
(half-step) higher while playing it. Joachim who was in
the audience came behind the stage to congratulate the
players, and gave Brahms letters of introduction to Liszt,
then at Weimar, and Schumann at Düsseldorf. This visit
led to Schumann’s article about him, mentioned at the
opening of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Brahms and the Schumann’s</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Brahms became a favorite visitor at the home of Schumann
and his brilliant wife Clara Schumann. He was
hailed by all the celebrities who assembled at the frequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>soirées and musicales, as a musician of great promise.
His compositions show a strong influence of this early
friendship. But Brahms repaid this kindness, for when
the ill-fated Schumann died, he became like a son to the
bereaved Clara Schumann, who loved him as one.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this splendid pianist had played her husband’s piano
works all over Europe, so she made known the first piano
concerto of her young friend. She made a success in spite
of the fact that it was not particularly well received at its
first performance at the Leipsic Gewandhaus, probably
because Brahms was not as great a pianist as he was a
composer. His feeling seems to have made him want
to turn the piano into an orchestra. He felt everything
in a massive way and was very exact.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the age of twenty-one Brahms became Director of
the Court Concerts and of the Choral Society of the Prince
of Lippe-Detmold. Being very conscientious he learned
much from this experience, which helped him toward becoming
one of the greatest writers of choral works as his
<cite>German Requiem</cite> and <cite>The Song of Fate</cite> prove.</p>

<p class='c008'>Outside of his music Brahms led an uneventful life.
He never married, and devoted such affection as he might
have given to a family to music. It is told that someone
who knocked at his door, receiving no answer, entered to
find him sobbing violently under the emotion caused by
some music that he was composing.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Brahms was about forty he visited Vienna and
was so delighted with the musical life he found there that he
remained for the rest of his days. As we note the delightful
swing of his <cite>Waltzes</cite>, it is easy to believe that he felt
the Viennese moods, which found their way into his compositions.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is little to say of his general habits except that he
was devotedly fond of out-door life and he interrupted
his work only to take long jaunts in the open, usually in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>company with sympathetic friends, for he was friendly,
and needed companionship. He did not give up all his
time to composing, for he was director of the great <cite>Singverein</cite>
(Choral Society) and he gave some marvelous performances
of the choral works of Bach, Beethoven, and of
other oratorios and masses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brahms died (1897) at sixty-four from a cold he caught
while attending the funeral of his friend Clara Schumann.
He now lies in the same cemetery as Beethoven and Schubert.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>His Contribution to Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Although Brahms did not create any new forms, there
are so many different sides in his compositions, that it is
hard to describe any one in particular. He came into the
world at the time when music was turning toward the
dramatic, because of Wagner’s influence. It seemed that
Brahms, himself, was afraid to hear Wagner, whose work
he admired. Brahms never wrote an opera and he never
wrote pictorial works such as tone poems. His writings
were “absolute music” that is, music in its purest form,
neither imitating nor representing anything but music.
Here was Brahms between the tone poems of Liszt, and
the operas of Wagner, and he remained true to pure music!
It is said that Hans von Bülow invited him to attend the
first performance of <cite>Parsifal</cite> but he refused saying that
he had a dread of Wagnerians, (but not of Wagner)! Although
Brahms wrote when the romantic school was at
its height, he brought back classicism with a force that
influenced the entire musical world. In addition to the
classic and romantic forms, many works are called <em>classic</em>
to distinguish them from <em>popular</em> music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brahms was of the peasant type, and honesty was one of
his strongest qualities. This honesty, sincerity and simplicity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>may be found in every line of his music, which
never has light or frothy moments, and which shows
everywhere that he loved Bach. He left a large number of
very great works. Indeed, one might study Brahms for
years and even then never know all he wrote.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was the center of a group of song writers to whom
he must have been an inspiration and an example. His
lyrical gift and form, which mean that his songs almost
sing themselves, was so great that it is hard to understand
how he could have written symphonies and sonatas which,
to many people, sound complex, thick and confused. But
many people, even good musicians feel this way about
Brahms. May we not believe that some day their ears
will be opened to its beauties and joys?</p>

<p class='c008'>The song writers of this period were many as they are in
all periods in every country. Many write one or two songs
that are lucky enough to become popular, but this does not
make a great composer, for the great either bring something
new into the world, or create music which by its quality
moves other people to write good and beautiful music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Song Writers</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Brahms towered among song writers after the time of
Schubert and Schumann. He carried forward the form
which has given Germany fame for her exquisite <i><span lang="de">lieder</span></i>
(songs). Great beauty with simplicity of vocal melody
against an accompaniment that had the character of a
full-fledged piano piece distinguished these songs from
those of an earlier period in which the accompaniment
gave just a little support to the singer. The old songs
however, were often heart appealing by their very simplicity
for they had almost a folk-song manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Franz Abt (1819–1885) was one of these writers. He
must have made a fortune out of <cite>When the Swallows Homeward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>Fly</cite>—only, as the composer can not control these
things, he probably never knew that this song was to be
found on nearly every piano in America for almost fifty
years!</p>

<p class='c008'>Robert Franz (1815–1892) made the world want to
singer German <i><span lang="de">lieder</span></i> for the haunting beauty of his songs.
<cite>The Rose Complained</cite> and <cite>In Autumn</cite> are fair examples of
a collection said to include 350 published songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Chapter XXIV you have seen the place in song occupied
by Schubert and Schumann. From them to Brahms
does not seem such a great stretch, but only the musician
knows how wide it is. The form in which Brahms wrote
<i><span lang="de">lieder</span></i> brought a new feeling to the composers, not by way
of imitation, but because vocal music developed naturally
into the paths along which he led the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Richard Strauss, known for his great tone poems, also
for his operas <cite>Salome</cite>, <cite>Elektra</cite> and <cite>The Rose Cavalier</cite>,
shortly after Brahms wrote some of the most beautiful
songs in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>We also find many by his colleagues, Felix Weingartner
(1863), Hans Pfitzner (1869), Mahler and others, whose
songs, though beautiful, showed their skill less than their
operas, symphonies, and choral works.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hugo Wolf—Song Genius</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Hugo Wolf (1860–1903) will be regarded, as time goes
on, as one of the greatest composers of the 19th century.
This, notwithstanding the fact that he published 260 songs
and nothing at all for orchestra, and in chamber music,
he wrote only one very interesting quartet introduced in
this country nearly twenty years ago by the Flonzaley
Quartet. Such a master would no doubt have left more
than songs, would have been one of the musical beacon-lights
of the world, had his life not been one of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>His story, indeed, exceeds in unhappiness that of Schumann
or even of Beethoven. Early in the best days of his
life, his mind began to give way, and during periods of
sanity he wrote with unbelievable fluency only to be suddenly
cut off from the power. He was fully aware of his
condition and his fate, and his letters expressing his emotions
and describing his agony are too sad to write about.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hugo Wolf, born at Windischgratz in Styria (1860) was
the fourth son of a leather-currier who was also a musician.
The home was the scene of much chamber music in which
Hugo played the second violin. The people of Styria
loved the old Italian operas, and Wolf frequently expressed
the belief that he had some Latin blood in his veins. This
seemed to show in his music for he wrote songs in Italian
and Spanish style and he was particularly attracted to
French music and musicians. One wonders could greater
songs have been written than his (<cite><span lang="de">Spanisches Liederbuch</span></cite>)
<cite>Spanish Song Book</cite> which includes not only thirty-four
brilliant folk-melodies, but also ten noble religious songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Romain Rolland, the great French writer on musical subjects
wrote: “It has been said that the <cite><span lang="de">Spanisches Liederbuch</span></cite>
is to Wolf’s work what <cite>Tristan</cite> is to Wagner’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed many who write of Wolf have said that his vivid
power of expression, and inspiration could only be compared
to Wagner’s. The poems he selected proved what a high
literary taste he had. For a time he was a musical critic
and made the bitterest enemies because of the abuse he
hurled at Brahms.</p>

<p class='c008'>His story may be quickly told for he got most of his
education from the libraries and from reading the scores
of the great masters. Having no piano he could be found
daily sitting on a bench in the park studying the Beethoven
sonatas. But he loved Wagner best of all, and held his
meeting with that master his life’s greatest joy. Wolf had
composed little until after he was twenty-eight, then his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>writing was feverish, interrupted only by his lapses of
mind. He died in one of these spells, of pneumonia, at
37. All his work was done in four or five years, for of the
last nine years during five of them (1890–95) he was prostrated
and often unable to speak.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bruckner</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Among the composers around this time and later, there
are but few who have left more than a ripple on the musical
ocean. Some created a stir in their own day and even now
there is hot discussion about them among the critics,
while some people are pleased and others are not.</p>

<p class='c008'>In those days, as now, every composer had his friends
and people who felt it to be their duty not only to stand up
for their friend, but to ridicule “the other fellow.” So it
was with Brahms, for in the same way that he was abused
by those who measured him against Wagner, his friends
refused to recognize in Anton Bruckner (1824–1896) a
rival of their idol (Brahms).</p>

<p class='c008'>Brahms was living in Vienna but he was not born there,
so the feeling was strong against him when he began to
threaten the position of the Viennese, Anton Bruckner,
who though nine years older than Brahms, was not recognized
so early. There was much in favor of Bruckner.
He was a very fine musician. Themes, melodies bubbled
forth constantly like an oil-gusher, but he did not know
how or when to stop them. If he had only known how to
control this continuous flow, he might have been as great
a figure as Brahms and the story of his life been different.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is wonderful, however, what he made of himself, for
he was a poor schoolmaster and organist who had only his
natural gifts to start with, and had little education. But
he wrote symphonies by the wholesale and they were so
long that they fairly terrified conductors to whom he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>brought them in the hope of having them performed. He
won his point, however, and lived to gain no small amount
of recognition. We heard several of his symphonies in
America in 1924, the hundredth anniversary of his birth
in Ausfelden, Upper Austria. He died in Vienna in 1896.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anton Bruckner wrote during the time of the height of
Richard Wagner’s glory and the dawn of Richard Strauss’s
fame, and was eleven years younger than Wagner, whom
he idolized.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mahler in America</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Gustav Mahler (1860–1911) enters at this point. It
would be difficult to make a definite statement about him,
for whatever be said for or against him, is sure to draw
argument. He had been a storm-center for many years
before his death, and even afterward those who were
against him waged war quite as bitterly, while those for
him fought more valiantly than ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>America was in the thick of this fight and many friendships
of long standing were broken on account of it. Mahler
living in New York as recently as 1908–1911 makes us
realize the more fully what men of genius have had to suffer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mahler was a powerful musical genius, with astounding
ability to work and amazing skill in handling his massive
scores. He died at the age of fifty-one leaving so many
symphonies, choral and festival works that it was a wonder
how one man could have accomplished that much even
had he lived to be a hundred.</p>

<p class='c008'>We marvel at his genius, but do we want to hear often
works that last for hours and hours? Some do, who can
follow his themes, his amazing treatment of them and his
ingenious writing for instruments. Others are fatigued
by the length of time he dwells upon one subject and by
the length of the work itself, and they sometimes object
to his strong contrasts in light and shade. But all this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>must be left to the future, the scales in which all art is
weighed. We should be thankful that America enjoyed
the benefits Mahler brought.</p>

<p class='c008'>He made his American début as conductor at the Metropolitan
Opera House, January 1, 1908, and in 1909 he
became conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.
The labor was so hard, more in trying to adjust himself
to the ideas of his Board of Directors than in the work
itself, that it broke his health and he returned to his home
to die that same year.</p>

<p class='c008'>He came here with a tremendous career behind him. It
was strange, having all his life led operas and produced
them in lavish fashion, he did not write one! But he did
write many beautiful and very difficult songs. When his
works are given, it is usually made a gala occasion, as they
can only be done by the largest organizations and with
the greatest artists. The Society of the Friends of Music
give some work by Mahler each season in New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gustav Mahler was born in Kalischt, Bohemia, and
died in Vienna. He studied philosophy at the Vienna
University and among his teachers of music were Julius
Epstein and Anton Bruckner.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Anton Seidl left the opera house of Prague, 1885–86,
Gustav Mahler jointly with Angelo Neumann succeeded
him. He made a great success of the Court Opera of Vienna
where he was director of the house and conductor
for ten years, but he demanded nothing short of perfection.
His insistent ardor for the best in music and in its
performance caused him the greatest unhappiness and really
cost him his life.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Max Reger</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Max Reger (1873–1916) caused a stir during the latter
part of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th.
His father, a schoolmaster and good organist, wanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>Max to be a schoolteacher, but at an early age young
Max began to write for piano and organ. After hearing
<cite><span lang="de">Die Meistersinger</span></cite> and <cite>Parsifal</cite> in Bayreuth (1888) he was
so stirred that he began to write big works. Reger was
perhaps most influenced by Bach, and notwithstanding his
very modern ideas he never lost sight of the old classic
form which may have made his work seem stiff and formal
at times. Some of his songs are very fine and his orchestral
numbers are frequently played in America.</p>

<p class='c008'>Max Bruch (1838–1920) was born in Berlin and besides
being a composer of chamber music, three symphonies and
familiar violin concertos, he wrote many choral works.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Father Franck</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>From this period, but not from this same country, arose
one of the most important and most beautiful influences
of the 19th century. We have learned enough about the
world’s great men to know that we can never judge by
appearances, unless we are keen enough to recognize a
beautiful soul when it looks through kindly eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such was the countenance of César Franck (born in Liège,
Belgium, 1820—died in Paris, 1890), often called the “French
Brahms”—but he was neither French, nor was he enough
like Brahms to have been so called. While César Franck
was not French, we may say that the entire French school
of the second half of the 19th century was of his making.
This, because instead of devoting himself to playing in
public and making long concert tours, he preferred to have
a quiet home life so that he could compose. This seriously
disappointed his father who had sent him from
Liège to the Paris Conservatory.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was but five years of age when Beethoven died, but
his work throughout his entire life strongly showed the
influence of the Master of Bonn, perhaps because his first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>teacher in Paris was Anton Reicha, a friend and admirer
of Beethoven.</p>

<p class='c008'>While all of Beethoven’s nine symphonies are known and
played all over the world, César Franck is known by one
which is played very often and by all orchestras. Where
Beethoven wrote many sonatas both for piano alone and
for piano and violin, when we hear the name of César
Franck, we immediately think of the one famous sonata
for violin and piano which was so popular that it was also
arranged for violoncello. This was written in very free
and practically new form.</p>

<p class='c008'>César Franck has written a number of fine works for
piano and for orchestra, and for stringed instruments, but
when it comes to organ works, it would take a large volume
to tell of them. Most pianists play the <cite>Prelude</cite>, <cite>Aria</cite>
and <cite>Finale</cite>, also the <cite>Prelude</cite>, <cite>Chorale</cite> and <cite>Fugue</cite>, just as
nearly all the violinists play the sonata, which are masterpieces.
Being deep in church music, and also a very religious
man it was perhaps natural that among his best
known works should be <cite><span lang="fr">Les Béatitudes</span></cite> for orchestra, chorus
and soloists, and <cite>Redemption</cite>, a work sung frequently
by the Oratorio Societies of America and Europe. It
was d’Indy who said: “In France, symphonic music
originated with the school of César Franck.” There were
not, however, many symphonies, but he was a master in
the symphonic poem. The best known among these are
<cite><span lang="fr">Les Éolides</span></cite> (<cite>The Æolides</cite>), <cite><span lang="fr">Les Djinns</span></cite> on Victor Hugo’s
splendid poem of that name and <cite><span lang="fr">Le Chasseur Maudit</span></cite> (<cite>The
Accursed Hunter</cite>). Also very well known is the piano quintet,
and we hear sometimes the Symphonic Variations for
piano and orchestra.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Franck at the Paris Conservatory</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>César Franck was different from most composers, for <em>his</em>
father, like Father Mozart, was very determined that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>should be a pianist and took the boy on a concert tour
when he was only ten years of age! He gave concerts
throughout Belgium, and at fourteen his father took him
with his brother Joseph to the Paris Conservatory, where
later he became a distinguished professor.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are many examples in life where a talent runs away
with its possessor. So it was with young César, who, after
only a year’s schooling, entered the <em>concours</em> or competition.
He covered himself with glory in the piano piece
he had to play, but when he was tested for reading at sight,
it flashed through his head how funny it would be to transpose
the piece three notes lower! And so he did, without a
mistake! But the judges were so horrified that he should
dare do anything different from what was expected that
they decided not to give him the prize because he had
broken the rules! But, Cherubini, our old acquaintance
there was great enough to know what the boy had done,
and through his influence a special prize was created for
César Franck called the Grand Prix d’Honneur which has
never, since then, been conferred upon anyone!</p>

<p class='c008'>César Franck was very mild and sweet in nature but
when it came to his music he was almost rebellious in his
independence. To understand the degree of his daring
you must know what a <em>concours</em> means.</p>

<p class='c008'>The graduating classes of the Paris Conservatory are
drawn up to play their pieces and to receive the criticism
of the judges, and the prizes. They all play the same thing
so the judges can tell exactly how each compares with the
other. Five of the most famous musicians of the world
are selected and they sit in judgment. Imagine this terrifying
ordeal! A couple of years after the first occurrence,
César Franck had to enter an organ competition, and
again his genius got away from his judgment. He was
expected to improvise a sonata on one subject given him
by the judges and a fugue on another subject. Franck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>passed in very orderly fashion through the first part, but
when it came to the fugue he thought how amusing it
would be to work the sonata subject into the fugue subject,
a feat which startled these wise judges by its colossal
daring and the stupendous manner in which he accomplished
it. But did they give him the first prize? Not
they! Talk about “Red Tape”—he had not followed the
rules and all he received out of the brilliant feat was a
second prize! But the world got César Franck.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Composer, Teacher, Organist</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We little realize how a tiny deed may influence the world!
We may almost reckon that a kind-hearted priest was
responsible for what César Franck became as a composer!
After he had had the wonderful musical training at the
Conservatory he refused to travel as a concert artist,
but wanted to remain at home and marry. This separated
him completely from his father. Besides wanting his son
to play, he objected to his marrying an actress when he
was twenty-six. Here is where the priest first befriended
him, for he performed the ceremony that made them man
and wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the days of revolution in Paris (1848) were upon
them and pupils did not come in great numbers. Poverty
such as Franck had never known faced him and his bride.
But his good friend the priest was called to a church and
he immediately appointed César Franck as organist. The
instrument was very fine and his happiness was complete
for he loved church services above everything. This
brought him directly under the musical influence of Bach,
which after all, was the greatest in his life. Later he became
organist of Saint Clothilde where the organ was even
finer and his composing hours were fairly absorbed by writing
for the organ.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>The programs given by concert-organists are usually
divided between Bach and César Franck, with a few numbers
by Alexandre Guilmant, the great French organist,
Charles Marie Widor, Theodore Dubois and a few other
Frenchmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>With all the composition that this grand old man of
musical France left behind him, he left a still greater thing
in the young men who were his pupils, some of whom were
among the most important figures in the late 19th century.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a singular fact that César Franck died almost exactly
as did two of his most famous pupils, Ernest Chausson and
Emmanuel Chabrier. The former was killed in the Bois
de Boulogne while riding a bicycle and Chabrier was killed
by a fall from a horse. Their beloved professor was knocked
down by an omnibus, and although he seemed to recover
and continue with his lessons and composing, he became
ill from the effects and died a few months later, in his 68th
year.</p>

<p class='c008'>During this last illness he wanted to get out of bed to
try three new <i><span lang="fr">chorales</span></i> for organ, which he read through
day after day as the end approached. This was the last
music from his pen for the manuscripts were lying beside
him when the priest gave him the last rites of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p class='c008'>If one could sum up the outstanding features of César
Franck’s music, they would be nobility and lofty spirit, true
reflections of his unfaltering religious faith.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Franck’s Pupils</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>César Franck did more than just devote teaching hours
to his pupils. He had them come to his home, and surrounded
by youth and enthusiasm, his own power grew
greater. They played their new works for each other and
for the Master, and out of this was born the <cite><span lang="fr">Société Nationale</span></cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>(National Society). It swung both the public taste
and the composers out of the light, frivolous opera of the
day into a love for, and a support of French symphonic and
chamber music. The Society was founded in 1871, just
following the Franco-Prussian war and was a protest
against the German musical domination in France, in fact
it was a direct aim against Wagner. In spite of the fact
that Franck was influenced by Bach, Beethoven and Wagner,
he worked sincerely to develop the classic French
school outside of opera form.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another great national institution which grew out of
the influence of César Franck was the famous Schola Cantorum
founded by Vincent d’Indy and Charles Bordes, his
pupils, and Alexandre Guilmant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the Franck pupils in addition to d’Indy and
Bordes may be mentioned, as a few of the foremost, Alexis
de Castillon (1838–1873), Emmanuel Chabrier (1842–1894),
Henri Duparc (1848) famous for some of the most
beautiful songs in all French music, Ernest Chausson (1855–1899),
Guillaume Lekeu (1870–1894), of the Netherlands,
and composer of <cite>Hamlet</cite>, a tone poem and other pieces,
Pierre de Bréville (1861), Guy Ropartz (1864), Gabriel
Pierné, Paul Vidal, and Georges Marty.</p>

<p class='c008'>But his influence did not stop here, for it touched many,
including such close friends as Alexandre Guilmant and
Eugene Ysaye, the renowned violinist, as well known in
America as in Europe. He was a countryman of César
Franck and played for its first performance anywhere,
Franck’s violin sonata dedicated to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alberic Magnard (1865–1914), was related musically to
Franck through d’Indy his chief teacher. Magnard met
death by the enemy in his own home during the war.</p>

<p class='c008'>We could fill a volume concerning these interesting men,
but we must continue our musical journey. From among
them, however, we must learn a little more about Vincent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>d’Indy, not only because he is a great composer and
teacher, but he has taught many Americans.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Vincent d’Indy</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Vincent d’Indy (1851) a musician of finest qualities
and almost countless achievements, is a cultured and educated
gentleman. He was brought up by his grandmother,
a woman of education and refinement, for his mother died
when he was very young. He therefore learned to love
culture and elegance early in his life, but this did not prevent
him from doing the sort of work which make men a
benefit to art and to mankind. In addition to being a
musician, he is a skilled critic and writer, also a great
teacher and organizer, proof of which may be found in what
he has done for France, indeed, for the world, in the Schola
Cantorum. He has written many books as well as magazine
and newspaper articles and an immense number of
musical compositions. He was born in Paris and was a member
of the Garde-Mobile during the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

<p class='c008'>Until the time that he left home for military service he
studied the piano with Louis Dièmer, a noted pianist and
teacher of Paris, and harmony with Marmontel and Lavignac,
both equally famous. Upon his return from war
service, his days with César Franck began, and these were
precious hours for both the pupil and the teacher who recognized
the young man’s power.</p>

<p class='c008'>He made several trips to Germany, the first in 1873
when he carried to Brahms the César Franck score of
<cite>Redemption</cite> sent with the composer’s compliments. At
this time he also met Liszt and Wagner, and later he attended
the Bayreuth performances including the world
première (first performance) of <cite>Parsifal</cite>. His musical activities
led him from the organ loft to becoming tympani
(kettle-drums) player in the Colonne Orchestra, where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>went, no doubt, to learn the instruments of the orchestra
and how to handle them. He found out, because he is
most skilled in writing for orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has had many prominent pupils, and it is his pride
and his ambition to continue along the lines laid down by
César Franck. He has had more than ordinary success
as a conductor going to many countries to conduct his own
compositions. He came twice to America as guest conductor
of the Boston Symphony appearing with that organization
in its home and also in New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vincent d’Indy, following the ideal of Franck is largely
responsible for the return of music in his country to symphony,
from which it had strayed far. In this period there
was a general feeling to bring music back to classical form.
This young school was doing it in France as Brahms had
done it in Germany and the result was that many composers
wrote symphonies. If we look through musical history
since then, we will find that the revival of a feeling for the
classics has helped to make the latter part of the 19th
century very rich.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although d’Indy has written several operas, there has
been no attempt to give them in this country, which is
strange because it is very difficult to get operas that are
worth producing at the Metropolitan Opera House or in
Chicago, the only other city in America that supports its
own opera on a large scale.</p>

<p class='c008'>D’Indy is living in Paris (1925), where the life around
him bristles with study, achievement and ambition. He
is as much of an inspiration to his pupils as was his own
teacher, but this is the 20th century, in which conditions,
and men, are different from those of the past! He has not
stood still but has gone steadily ahead, although his influence
upon the very modern writers must have been healthy
and restraining, notwithstanding the fact that only a few
years ago <em>he</em> was regarded as a modern.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Gabriel Fauré</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In the musical history of France, the name of Gabriel
Fauré (1845–1924) looms high. He was born in Pamiers,
and was taught by the Dean of French musical folk, Camille
Saint-Saëns. Like all the musicians of France, no matter
whether or not they planned to use it as a profession,
they devoted as much time to the organ as to the piano, and
most of them became famous organists even though they
had not planned to be organists. For this reason France
has more great organists and organ compositions to offer
than any other country of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gabriel Fauré became the organist of Rennes and later
went to Saint Sulpice and Saint Honoré, and finally he
became organist of the Madeleine in 1896. These churches
are among the greatest in France, and to be organist in
any one of them means that he is a great musician.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fauré had honors showered upon him for he gave his
country some of the most brilliant works contributed by
any of her sons. In France the compositions of Gabriel
Fauré are highly valued, but with the exception of a few
songs, are not known in America, the more the pity. Fauré
is better known here as the head of the Conservatory in
which his life was spent until his very recent death. He
went there to share the classes in composition, counterpoint
and fugue with André Gédalge, succeeding Jules Massenet,
and in 1905 Fauré succeeded Theodore Dubois as
Director of the Conservatory. Still more honors heaped
upon him made him a member of the <cite><span lang="fr">Académie</span></cite>, for which
no one can be named until there is a vacancy. He was therefore
the successor to Ernest Reyer.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1910 the world was much stirred when Gabriel Fauré
was made Commander of the Legion of Honor, a distinction
given only when a man has done something very great.</p>

<p class='c008'>In addition to these tributes to his standing in the community
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>and his achievements as an artist, he took numerous
prizes for his compositions of which there were three
operas, much incidental music, symphonies, a well known
violin and piano sonata, some fine chamber music and
much music for the organ and for choruses. But beyond
the appreciation always shown Fauré for his larger works,
he will always be loved in France because he was regarded
as the French Schubert, so lovely were his melodies and so
lavishly did he write.</p>

<p class='c008'>He kept pure and true the ideals and characteristics of
French music, more so, indeed, than did many who may be
better known to the concert-goers of this country.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>English Composers in Classical Forms</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>While the Germans, French and Austrians were writing,
England had composers, who although not so famous,
nevertheless kept music alive in England.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir William Sterndale Bennett (1816–1875) with his many
orchestral and choral works of which his cantata, <cite>The
Woman of Samaria</cite>, is best known; Sir George A. Macfarren
(1813–1887) with operas and oratorios, especially his
cantata, <cite>Rebekah</cite>; his brother, Walter Cecil Macfarren
(1826–1905), conductor, and composer of orchestral music;
Sir John Stainer (1840–1901), organist, composer of very
lovely anthems, and much church music, and Professor of
Music at Oxford; Sir Frederick Bridge (1844–1924), organist
of Westminster Abbey, writer of text-books on music,
and of anthems, part songs and oratorios; Sir Arthur C.
Mackenzie (1847), composer of many works including two
Scotch symphonies and a cantata, <cite>The Cottar’s Saturday
Night</cite>; Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (1848–1918),
Professor of Music at Oxford after Stainer, and writer of
many important books on music and of compositions in
many forms; Arthur Goring Thomas (1851–1892), who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>wrote operas, cantatas, and many songs; Sir Frederick
Hymen Cowen (1852), with operas, cantatas, symphonies
and chamber music; Sir Charles Villiers Stanford (1853–1924),
born in Dublin, Ireland, Professor of Music at
Cambridge since 1887, student of Irish folk music, and
writer of chamber music and short pieces, also of valuable
books on musical history and other musical subjects;
Edward German (1862), famous for his <cite>Henry VIII</cite>
Dances, much incidental theatre music, and an operetta,
<cite>The Moon Fairies</cite>, in which he used the last libretto written
by Sullivan’s inimitable partner, Sir W. S. Gilbert; and
Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875–1912), an Englishman of
African descent, whose music for chorus and for orchestra is
based on American Indian legend, and on Negro folk songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>And living today is Edward William Elgar (1857), the
dean of English composers. While not adding to the new
music, he is famous for many pieces, among which are <cite>The
Dream of Gerontius</cite>, <cite>The Apostles</cite>, other oratorios, symphonies,
and his march, <cite>Pomp and Circumstance</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Women Writers in England</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Among the women in England, Dame Ethel Smyth
(<em>Dame</em> is an honorary title in England) (1858) is known for
her opera <cite>The Wreckers</cite>, and her comic opera <cite>The Boatswain’s
Mate</cite>. Some of her operas have been performed
at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York and at
Covent Garden, London. Besides she has written songs
for the Suffrage Movement, incidental music, and music
in large forms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liza Lehman (1862–1918), wrote <cite>In a Persian Garden</cite>,
<cite>Nonsense Songs</cite>, and <cite>The Daisy Chain</cite>, which made her
famous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poldowski,” Lady Dean Paul, daughter of Wieniawski,
the Polish composer and violinist, has written piano
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>pieces and lovely songs in Debussy style. She has had
considerable influence in getting the work of the younger
British composers and her countryman, Szymanowski,
heard in London.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rebecca Clarke, a young Englishwoman, has written
several chamber music works which place her in the foremost
rank of women composers. On two occasions she
received “honorable mention” in the Berkshire chamber
music prize competition offered by Mrs. F. S. Coolidge, at
Pittsfield, Massachusetts.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIX<br> <span class='c016'>Music Appears in National Costumes</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>We cannot tell you very much about the history of
music in Russia because until the 19th century, the
Russians had little but their folk songs and church music.
For many centuries the Christian priests disliked to have
them sing their legends and folk songs because they were
not of Christian origin and so music had a very difficult
road to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another thing which kept music as an art from growing,
was the edict in the Church against the use of instruments.
But as there is always a silver lining to every cloud the
unaccompanied singing became very lovely.</p>

<p class='c008'>For ages, then, there was the most strikingly beautiful
natural music in the folk tunes of this gigantic country,
three times as large as the United States. Its cold
bleak steppes or plains and its nearness to the East gave
them fascinating and fantastic legends, and a music sad,
wild and colorful with strange harmonies—their inheritance
from the Slavs and Tartars. All these date back to days
before the Christian era, so you can understand even
though they are of surpassing beauty, the Church was
afraid of the wild, tragic, pagan melodies and rhythms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the early 18th century, at the time of and after Peter
the Great, there were many Europeans who came to Russia
and brought along their music or their own national ideas
of music, so that Russia had foreign opera and foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>teachers. When Catharine the Great was Queen she appreciated
the wonderful store of folk legends and was very
good to composers both Italian and Russian, of whom there
were very few.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very soon, a man from Venice, Catterino Cavos, went
over and was clever enough to write Italian opera using the
Russian folk songs and legends. This was a fine idea, because
it gave suggestions to Russians as to what could be
done with their folk songs. The next thing that happened
was the terrible defeat of Napoleon, in 1812, by the Russians
and the burning of Moscow. When important political
things happen and when a favorite city is nearly destroyed,
people’s imaginations are stirred and it makes them think
about the things of their own land. The Russians were no
different from other folks. After the way was prepared by
Vertowsky, Dargomyzhsky, and Seroff, Michael Glinka
(1804–1857) wrote his opera, <cite>A Life For the Tsar</cite>, for the
time was ripe for serious Russian national music. He was
tired of the music of the Italians, introduced into Russia in
1737, and the French music introduced by Boieldieu and
others a little after 1800. He made a close study of Russian
folk song and of composition, and became the father of
the new Russian music. He studied in Leningrad (St.
Petersburg) with Charles Mayer and John Field, the Irish
composer of nocturnes who found his way into Russia with
Clementi. Glinka became an invalid and his travels for
his health brought him to Paris where he was very much
interested in the works of Berlioz. When he wrote his first
opera, he said he wanted the Russians “to feel at home,”
and so we see in it the magic background of Russia with the
flavor and interest of the Orient. Another opera of his was
<cite>Ruslan and Ludmilla</cite> which also pictures their national life.
Besides this, Glinka, in some Spanish caprices, brought
Spanish folk songs before the eyes of the musical art
world.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>An important group followed in the footsteps of Glinka,
called “The Five.” The members wanted national music
and sincere opera in any form they desired. The Russian
Ballet, which tells a story and is not a mere exhibition of
fancy steps, was an outcome of this freedom.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were two schools about this time in Russia, constantly
at odds with each other. The “Russian Five” was
one school and the leaders of the other were Anton and
Nikolai Rubinstein and Peter Ilytch Tchaikovsky (1840–1893)
whose fame is probably greater than any other Russian.
Tchaikovsky became very interested in the European
composers, and studied composition with the founder
of the Petrograd Conservatory, Anton Rubinstein. He was
made professor of harmony at the Moscow Conservatory
in 1866. While there he wrote many operas and articles
for Moscow papers. He married unhappily and had a
nervous breakdown in 1877 and lived very quietly, a sensitive
nervous man all his life. He visited the United States
in 1891, and conducted his Sixth Symphony, <cite>The Pathetique</cite>,
at the opening of Carnegie Hall in New York City. Visiting
England and then returning to Russia, he died in 1893
of cholera. Besides the symphonic poems about which we
told you, he wrote several overtures, six symphonies, four
suites, three ballets, eleven operas, two of which, <cite><span lang="fr">La
Pique Dame</span></cite> and <cite>Eugen Onegin</cite> have been given outside of
Russia.</p>

<p class='c008'>His work is very emotional and often tragic with captivating
melodies often based on folk songs with rich orchestral
color. But withal, his work was based more on the German
tendencies and forms of music than the works of the
younger Russians, therefore, Tchaikovsky and Rubinstein
were pitched in musical battle for some years against this
other school.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>The Five</span>”</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Alexander Borodin (1834–1887), a scientist and physician
and a friend of Liszt, wrote crashing and flashy music
with what they called “Modern harmonies.” It seemed
full of discords for the people of his time but to us is fascinating
and piquant! His <cite>Prince Igor</cite>, a story of adventure
and war not unlike <cite><span lang="fr">Le Chanson de Roland</span></cite>, is a beautiful
opera with striking melody and dances.</p>

<p class='c008'>Modeste Moussorgsky (1839–1881) probably had more
natural genius than any of the rest of “The Five,” even
though his work had to be edited by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov
(1844–1908). Moussorgsky’s music had the real
spirit of Russia, sad, colorful, full of wild dances based as is
most of this Russian music, on the folk songs of his native
land. Besides this, it is very human and touches the soul
of people as they listen. His songs are real treasures. His
music is truly a portrait of the Russian people.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote a very beautiful opera called <cite>Boris Godounov</cite>
richly laden with the Oriental color, and pathos and tragedy
of Russia’s past. A very interesting thing to know is that
Rimsky, because of his wider knowledge of harmony and
orchestration, corrected Moussorgsky’s works and very
often changed things that seemed to him quite wrong. Recently
we have examined a score of Moussorgsky and compared
it to the corrected version of Rimsky and we now
find that Moussorgsky’s score was even more vivid and
modern to our ears than Rimsky’s. Several composers
have arranged for orchestra Moussorgsky’s piano pieces,
<cite>Pictures from an Exposition</cite>, and have brought out beauties
in color, humor and scenic painting in the music.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next man, Mily Balakirev (1837–1910), a country
boy steeped in folk songs, became the founder and leader of
this Group of Five. He founded a free music school in
Petrograd and later became the conductor of the Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Musical Society, of the Imperial Musical Society, and Imperial
Chapel. His works are chiefly in symphony form,
brilliantly and effectively orchestrated. Some of his piano
pieces and songs are very beautiful, but his greatest gift to
music was his careful study of Russian national story and
song, and he furthered the revival of the Oriental in Russian
musical art.</p>

<p class='c008'>César Cui (1835–1918), born at Vilna, Poland, was the
son of a French officer, and became a great authority on
military science. He wrote eight operas which were more
lyric than dramatic and, as Balakirev’s friend and first disciple
among “The Five,” he helped this younger Russian
School with his musical compositions and writings for the
press.</p>

<p class='c008'>Last but not the least of this “Five” is Nikolai Rimsky
Korsakov (1844–1908), who was born in Novgorod, and
while a student at the Petrograd Naval College, became an
advocate of the theories of Balakirev to keep Russian
music, Russian. While on a three-year cruise, he wrote his
first symphony, and on another, as a young naval officer,
he came to America.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very soon he left the navy and became a teacher and
conductor in Petrograd. He is best known in this country
for his orchestral suite, <cite>Shéhérazade</cite>, which gives a glamorous
picture of some of the stories from “The Arabian Nights”
as told by the Persian Queen, Shéhérazade. Another famous
thing of his, is his second symphony <cite>Antar</cite>. Probably no
other person among the Russians could give you the effect
and colorfulness of the Orient as Rimsky. He takes most
of his stories from Russian legends and his operas are entrancing.
The best of these are <cite>The Snow Maiden</cite>, <cite>Sadko</cite>,
and the humorous, fantastic and tuneful <cite>Coq d’Or</cite> (“The
Golden Cockerel”). He has written works for the piano, and
some of the songs out of his operas, such as <cite>The Song of
India</cite> and <cite>Shepherd Lehl</cite> are probably familiar to you.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>These five men and the group including Anton and
Nikolai Rubinstein, Sergei Tanieiev (1856–1915) and
Tchaikovsky, were very antagonistic, as we said before,
until finally some of the Five went on the staff of the various
conservatories in Russia and the breach seemed to be healed;
and now new men have appeared, out-distancing even the
Five in modern harmony, Alexander Scriabin (1872–1919)
and Igor Stravinsky (1882).</p>

<p class='c008'>Coming after these celebrated Russians were Anton
Arensky (1861–1906), Alexander Glazounov (1865), both
writers of symphonies, piano pieces and chamber music,
Anatole Liadov (1855–1914), Serge Liapounov (1859), Nikolai
Medtner (1879), Catoire, Reinhold Glière (1875), Ippolitov
Ivanov (1859), Alexander Gretchaninov (1864), Serge Vassilenko
(1872), Theodor Akimenko and Sergei Rachmaninov
(1873), who has spent many years in America where he is
known as a brilliant composer and gifted pianist. (Page
<a href='#Page_409'>409</a>.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bohemia—Czecho-Slovakia</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Another country rich in national characteristics, donning
national costume in art music as well as in folk music, is
Bohemia—or Czecho-Slovakia. It is the land of harp
players, street musicians and the gypsy, where nearly everybody
seems to be musical. The Esterhazy family, nobles
who were patrons of Haydn and other composers, were
Bohemians.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Prague, their principal city, Gluck, Mozart, Weber
and many other foreigners were appreciated when their
own countries turned deaf ears to them, but it is not
until the middle of the 19th century, that Bohemia gave
the world its own composers. Among these were Frederick
Smetana (1824–1884), a pupil of Liszt and a fine pianist.
He became the opera conductor at Prague and like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>Beethoven, became afflicted with deafness, but it unbalanced
his mind and he died in an insane asylum at sixty.
He wrote a number of pieces for chamber combinations,
symphonic poems, symphonies and operas of which the
best known is the <cite>Bartered Bride</cite>, a picture of Bohemian
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest Bohemian and one of the ablest musicians of
the 19th century, is Antonin Dvorak (pronounced Dvorjak)
(1843–1904), a peasant and son of an innkeeper and butcher
at Mühlhausen. Coming from the people, he was familiar
with the folk songs, and although his father wanted him to
be an innkeeper and butcher, Antonin used to follow the
strolling players and showed a decided talent for music.
He learned to sing, to play the violin and the organ, and
studied harmony. Later he went to Prague to continue his
work. He was very poor but Smetana befriended him,
and five years after he entered school, he wrote his first
string quartet. Thirteen years afterwards, he became organist
at $60.00 a year at St. Adalbert’s Church. He is
another man whom Liszt helped by performing his works
and finding publishers for them. He became famous
through his fascinating <cite>Slavonic Dances</cite> and was soon invited
to London after his <cite>Stabat Mater</cite> had been performed
there. He wrote <cite>The Spectre’s Bride</cite> for the Birmingham
Festival of 1885, and his oratorio for the Leeds Festival,
<cite>St. Ludmilla</cite>, in the following year. The University of
Cambridge made him Doctor of Music and before that, he
had been Professor of Music at the Prague Conservatory.
Soon he came to New York and received a salary of $15,000
a year as director of the New York Conservatory of Music.
Homesickness overcame him and he went back to Bohemia
where his opera, <cite>Armide</cite>, was given before he died.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dvorak was a sound musician. He had studied Mozart,
Beethoven and Schubert but was devoted to his own folk-lore
and the harmonies which appealed to his nation. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>was particularly interested in national types of music and
when in America the negro music appealed to him tremendously.
While here, he taught H. C. Burleigh, the negro
composer and singer, with whom he had an interesting and
fruitful friendship. When he went back to Bohemia, he
wrote the <cite>New World Symphony</cite>, built on negro folk ideas,
and a string quartet in which he has used negro themes.
Isn’t it curious that it often takes an outsider to show us
the beauties at our own door step?</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote many songs, symphonic poems and five symphonies
and many other forms of music. Although he was
very strict in the use of form, his work was free, full of
melody and imagination. It is distinguished by warm
color, beautiful rhythms and flowing melody, daring modulations
and withal a sense of naturalness. Some people
consider him one of the greatest masters of orchestration
of the 19th century. Probably you have heard Fritz
Kreisler and many others play the famous <cite>Humoresque</cite>, and
you may also know his incomparable <cite>Songs My Mother
Taught Me</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Roumania</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Georges Enesco (1881) a most gifted violinist, conductor
and composer, born in Cordaremi, is the principal
representative of Roumania. His first work is <cite><span lang="fr">Poème
Roumain</span></cite>, in which, as well as in many others, he shows his
Roumanian birth. He wrote symphonies and other orchestral
works, chamber music and songs.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Land of the Polonaise</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Poland first springs into prominence as an art center in
music with Frédéric Chopin, but it has produced many
other pianists and pianist-composers,—among them, Carl
Tausig.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>If you like brilliant salon and over-decorated pieces, you
will enjoy the works of Moritz Moszkowski (1854–1924),
who was born of Polish descent in Breslau. He was a fine
pianist and had a long list of pupils including the brilliant
American, Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poland has given us Ignace Jan Paderewski (1860), whose
<cite>Minuet</cite> you probably know, and whose amazing piano
skill is familiar to you. While he has written many
piano pieces, a fairly successful gypsy opera, <cite>Manru</cite>, an
interesting piano concerto and a symphony, it is as pianist
that he will be remembered. He has been the idol of
every nation in which he has played.</p>

<p class='c008'>His pupil, Sigismund Stojowski (1870), has lived in
America since 1906 and has written orchestral works, a
piano concerto and many piano pieces.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Land of the Fiords and Skalds—Norway and Sweden</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Here is another country with a rich folk-lore, half pagan
and half Christian.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ole Bull, the violinist, also did much for Norwegian
music in the 19th century. One of the first composers was
Halfdan Kjerulf (1815–1868) who was born in Christiania
(Oslo) and studied in Leipsic. He gave up his life to composition.
Henrietta Sontag as well as Jenny Lind introduced
his songs to the public; like his delightful piano
pieces they are national in flavor. If you have the chance,
hear his <cite>Lullaby</cite> and <cite>Last Night</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Norway! The land of the Vikings, of Odin and Thor, of
the eddas and sagas, of skalds and harpists, of sprites and
trolls, fiords, mountain kings and the mischievous Peer
Gynt—all brought to life by the magic wand of Edvard
Hagerup Grieg (1843–1907).</p>

<p class='c008'>Surely one of the greatest poet-composers of recent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>times, he brought out the beauties of the Norwegian
folk song and dance, and dressed up serious music in national
costume. Ole Bull assisted Grieg by recognizing
his ability when he was a very young man. Grieg was sent
to the Leipsic Conservatory but he overworked and became
ill, and went to Copenhagen, where he met Niels
Gade, under whose guidance some of his earlier works were
written. He returned to Norway and was again stimulated
by Ole Bull; he met a young composer, Rikard
Nordraak, and together they did a good deal of work toward
establishing a national school. Again Liszt acts as an
international aid society to young musicians, for he now
befriends Grieg in Rome. The government of Norway
granted a life pension to Grieg so that he might give all his
time to composition, after which he wrote incidental music
to the celebrated <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> of Ibsen. He lived in the
country and in 1885 built his villa “Troldhaugen” near
Bergen. His wife, who is still living in “Troldhaugen,”
sang many of his songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>His short pieces are like portraits of Norway and he is
able to catch with marvelous ease and simplicity, the
peculiar harmonies, mingling minor and major keys together
in a most charming way. Although a lyric writer,
he has written a piano sonata, three sonatas for violin and
piano, and a most effective piano concerto, all of which
show brilliancy and keen dramatic sense. His <cite>Holberg
Suite</cite> for piano and the <cite>Elegiac</cite> melodies and the Norwegian
theme for strings are full of rich, romantic feeling. As a
song writer, too, Grieg ranks very high.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the other Norwegians are: Johan Severan
Svendsen (1840–1911), Wagnerian in feeling yet writing
his compositions with strong Norwegian color. Christian
Sinding (1856), whose <cite>Rustling of Spring</cite> you will remember,
puts on the national costume of his native Norway
in his writings, although educated in Germany. Among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>others are Johan Selmer, Gerhard Schjelderup and Madam
Agathe Backer-Gröndahl, pianist-composer of decided
charm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jenny Lind, the “Swedish Nightingale” (1820–1887)
and Christine Nilsson (1843–1921), did much to bring
Norse folk songs to the attention of the world. These
melodies were very much admired because they reflected
the coolness and the sadness of the land of the fiords.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Denmark</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We now go to the land of Buxtehude, the celebrated
organist of Lübeck. Although J. Hartmann, director of
the Conservatory of Copenhagen, has been called “The
Father of Danish Music,” the first great composer was
Niels Wilhelm Gade (1817–1890). He started as a maker
of instruments, became a member of the Royal Orchestra
at Copenhagen and won a prize with his first work, an orchestral
overture, <cite>Echoes from Ossian</cite>. Mendelssohn played
this in Leipsic and from this time on they were great
friends. Gade succeeded him as conductor of the Gewandhaus
Concerts in Leipsic; in 1848, he returned to Copenhagen
and held many positions, among which was court
chapel master. Gade’s works were a mixture of the
Romantic and the Classic Schools to which he added
Danish qualities. He wrote well in symphonic style and in
choruses, songs and piano pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among others were Asger Hamerik (1843), a pupil
of Von Bülow and Berlioz, Otto Malling (1848–1915);
Ludwig Theodor Schytte (1850–1909), a student of Gade
and Liszt, who lived for a long time in Germany, where
he died. His short piano pieces are classics for all
young piano students. Edward Lassen, Victor Emanuel
Bendix and August Enna are other well known
Danes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sweden</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The first of the romantic writers in Sweden is Anders
Hallen (1846). His music was massive and Wagnerian
in effect, showing the somberness of the influence of his
native province Bohuslän. He had a great sense of melody
and his marches and dances in his native style are happy
and delightful. Emil Sjögren (1853–1918) was called “The
Schumann of the North,” for he wrote mostly piano pieces,
a beautiful violin sonata and vocal solos and showed a
great deal of charm and warmth of feeling. We might add
to this list Wilhelm Stenhammar, who wrote operas and
choral works, and Hugo Alfven.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Music in the Country of Lakes—Finland</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Finland, “the land of a thousand lakes,” and of virgin
forests and meadows, has always been a country of great
beauty and sadness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of all her composers, Jan Sibelius is the greatest (1865).
He was educated as a lawyer but being a violinist, he decided
to pursue a musical career. He is remarkable as a
writer of symphonic poems, and sings with compelling
beauty the legends of his country taken from <cite>The Kalevala</cite>,
the epic poem which ranks with the greatest legendary
poems of all times. Besides <cite>The Kalevala</cite> are the short
lyrics or Kanteletar, sung to the lute of steel strings, which
is called <cite>The Kantele</cite>. These legends and songs are always
a source of great joy to the Finns and were first arranged
by Elias Lönnrot in the early part of the 19th century. The
symphonic poems of Sibelius are <cite>Karelia</cite>, <cite>The Swan of
Tuonela</cite> and <cite>Lemminkäinen</cite> from <cite>The Kalevala</cite>. He wrote
other compositions, of course, including cantatas and
ballads and string quartets and choruses. His <cite>Finlandia</cite> is
a true picture of the Finnish people and country, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span><cite>Fourth Symphony</cite> is one of the 20th century’s monumental
works.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is interesting to note in his Finnish songs a peculiar
five-four rhythm which is haunting and fascinating. He
was recognized as a great musician, for he is the only
one of this time who drew a government pension. In
1914, Sibelius was in America for the Norfolk Festival for
which he had written a special work, a symphonic poem,
<cite>Aalottaret</cite> (Daughter of the Ocean). At the same time
Yale University conferred a degree upon him. He lives
far north in Finland away from cities, surrounded for many
months of the year by great snow fields.</p>

<p class='c008'>Selim Palmgren is a writer of charming piano pieces who,
in 1924, was teacher at the Eastman Conservatory in
Rochester, New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other composers in Finland were Bernard Crusell (1775–1838),
and Frederick Pacius (who was born in Hamburg
in 1809 and died in Helsingfors in 1891), the Father of
Finnish Music and the author of the National Hymn
<cite>Wartland</cite> and <cite>Suomis Song</cite> (Suomi means Finland). He
was a violinist, a follower of Spohr and composed a great
many musical works.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among others is Armas Järnefelt (1864), an orchestral
conductor and composer living in Stockholm.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Spain—The Land of the Fandango</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the most adventurous and likeable people that we
have met in the history of music is Isaac Albeniz (1860–1909).
He was born in Spain and started his travels when
he was a few days old. He ran away from home when he
was nine years old and toured about, making money by
playing the piano. He loved travel and his life as a young
man is a series of runnings-away-and-being-brought-back.
He became a very great pianist and Alphonso XII was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>pleased with his playing and so delighted with his personality,
that at fifteen he was granted a pension and being
free from money worry, he realized the dream of his life
and went to see Franz Liszt.</p>

<p class='c008'>He became a player approaching Von Bülow and Rubinstein
in skill.</p>

<p class='c008'>He kept composing attractive and popular Spanish tunes
using the rich, rhythmic Spanish folk songs in rather new
and modern harmony. He finally decided to give up his
life as a popular composer and brilliant pianist, and settled
down to serious composition. The next thirty pieces took
him longer to write than his four hundred popular songs!</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1893 he went to Paris in a most wonderful period,
and met Debussy, Fauré, Duparc and d’Indy.</p>

<p class='c008'>His most important composition is <cite>Iberia</cite>, a collection of
twelve Spanish piano pieces. Among his other things are
<cite>Serenade</cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Orientale</span></cite> and <cite>Aragonaise</cite>, all in Spanish dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a very rare personality with a rich nature, exuberant,
happy and merry, even until his death.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was the real center of Spanish music and influenced all
who came after him. He was to Spain what Grieg was to
Norway, Chopin to Poland, Moussorgsky to Russia, and
Dvorak to Bohemia or Czecho-Slovakia.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Enrique Granados</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Following Albeniz, was another great Spaniard, Enrique
Granados (1867–1916), who was born in Lérida, Spain, and
met a tragic death on a transport in the English Channel
during the World War. Unlike Albeniz, he did not write
in a modern vein, but rather in the accustomed harmonies.
He was more Spanish for this reason than Albeniz, less
original and without the great charm of the other master.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only opera in Spanish that has ever been sung at the
Metropolitan Opera House was his <cite>Goyescas</cite> in 1916. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>principal rôle was sung by Anna Fitziu. First he wrote this
as an opera in 1899. Later he made a piano version of it,
very much like a suite, which was played with great success
by Ernest Schelling. He also wrote symphonic poems
among which was <cite>Dante</cite> with a vocal part, sung by Sophie
Braslau, in 1915, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>He is one of Spain’s great sons and the rich and sincere
national spirit which he put into his music makes him beloved
of his compatriots.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXX<br> <span class='c016'>America Enters</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Not long ago we visited the medieval castle of Amboise
in Touraine, France, for the 400th celebration of the
birth of the French poet, Ronsard. (Chapter XI.) A
program of madrigals by Jannequin, Costeley, Lassus and
others who had used Ronsard’s poems as texts, was given
in the room where the poet himself had entertained his
friends. We were impressed by the beauty of the old
castle and the aged towers and ramparts. It was here
that we realized the meaning of <span class='fss'>TRADITION</span>!</p>

<p class='c008'>The peasant children passing under the watch tower in
the village below the castle are reminded daily of a past replete
with history and romance! They know without having
been taught that here their poet Pierre de Ronsard and
the Italian painter, Leonardo da Vinci, lived, worked and
died. This watch tower was old when Columbus discovered
America!</p>

<p class='c008'>The lack of tradition, this unconscious knowing of the
past, that Europe has in abundance is often held up to us in
America as a serious loss in our art life. The question
came to us: Is there nothing in our country to make up for
the absence of this historical and romantic background?</p>

<p class='c008'>As in a motion picture, there passed before our minds the
Grand Canyon of Arizona, the Rocky Mountains, the
snow-capped peaks of the Pacific slope, the Columbia River,
the Mississippi and the Hudson, Golden Gate of California,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>Niagara Falls, and the Plains, lonesome stretches of sand
and sage-brush vast as the sea! Surely such wondrous
beauty should inspire artists to create great works.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this is a day of cities, aeroplanes, automobiles, speed
and unrest, when the mind rules instead of the heart! And
we must “watch our step” or we will become the slaves of
this Age of Invention instead of being the masters. All
this is reflected in our art life and we must guard our creative
talent if we would rank with European nations in the
making of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>We already rank with them in performing it, and in organizations,
such as our orchestras, opera houses, chamber
music organizations, music schools, music settlements, music
club activities, community singing, glee clubs, oratorio
societies, and amateur orchestras. America needs music
and loves it as never before. Perhaps out of all this music
study and concert-giving in addition to what might be done
with the radio and mechanical instruments, which are now
making records of the world’s finest compositions, there
will come a race of real music lovers and creators. They
will study our national traits and will unite them with
the earnest work of American composers of today and
yesterday; they will open their minds to the natural beauties
of nature; they will try to raise the standard of the general
public, and they will make music in America grow. May
every American reader take this to heart!</p>

<p class='c008'>In our chapter on “National Portraits in Folk Music”
we told you that we have no definite traits in our music
that could be called national because this country was
settled by people of many different nationalities and races.
All these peoples brought to the “Promised Land” their
customs and traditions, their song and story world. We
can still see traces in the present generation of the early
settlers: New England and the South are Anglo-Saxon;
Louisiana and the northern border, French; California,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>Spanish; New York and Pennsylvania, Dutch; Minnesota,
Scandinavian; Missouri and Wisconsin, German.
Besides, the Italians, Irish, Russians and Germans have
settled in all parts of this huge “melting pot”!</p>

<p class='c008'>There is however an <em>Americanism</em> that is hard to
define, but is the result of the intermingling of all nationalities.
It is the spirit of the pioneer that sent our forefathers,
foreigners many, across the plains in the “covered
wagon”; the spirit of youth and enthusiasm of a country
still new; the spirit that works out gigantic commercial
problems and miraculous inventions with the same
fervor with which an artist creates; it is the spirit of an
inspired sculptor before the unfinished block of marble.
All of which must combine in our music before we can
create a national idiom.</p>

<p class='c008'>But we must go back and travel with you the rocky road,—“Music
in America.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pilgrims and Puritans</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Pilgrims and Puritans who reached our “stern and
rock-bound coast” early in the 17th century did not approve
of music, except for the singing of five hymn tunes!
The first book printed in America was the <cite>Bay Psalm Book</cite>
(1640) at Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its heading was:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Psalmes in Metre: Faithfully translated for the
Use, Edification, and comfort of the Saints in publick and
private, especially in New England.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Spiritual Songs” were not at first included, but later
about fifty English hymn tunes, sung in unison were used.
It went into many editions, found its way to England and
Scotland, and was preferred by many to all others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Music was forbidden as a trade in New England and a
dancing master was fined for trying to start a class. The
early settlers thought “to sing man’s melody is only a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>vain show of art” and objected to tunes because “they are
inspired”! So the Puritans were forbidden to invent
new tunes. You can understand that an art could not
easily flourish in such stony ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Oscar G. Sonneck, an authority on the history of
American music, says in his book, <cite>Early Concert-life in
America</cite>: “The Puritans, the Pilgrims, the Irish, the
Dutch, the Germans, the Swedes, the Cavaliers of Maryland
and Virginia and the Huguenots of the South may
have been zealots, adventurers, beggars, spendthrifts,
fugitives from justice, convicts, but barbarians they certainly
were not.... Possibly, or even probably, music
was at an extremely low ebb, but this would neither prove
that the early settlers were hopelessly unmusical nor that
they lacked interest in the art of ‘sweet conchord.’... What
inducements had a handful of people, spread over so
vast an area, struggling for an existence, surrounded by
virgin forests, fighting the Redman, and quarreling
amongst themselves, to offer to musicians? We may rest
assured that even Geoffrey Stafford, ‘lute and fiddle
maker’ by trade and ruffian by instinct, would have preferred
more lucrative climes and gracefully declined the
patronage of musical Governor Fletcher had he not been
deported in 1691 to Massachusetts by order of his Majesty
King William, along with a batch of two hundred other
Anglo-Saxon convicts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There were no musicians by trade,&#160;... and as the
early settlers were not unlike other human beings in having
voices, we may take it for granted that they used them
not only in church, but at home, in the fields, in the taverns,
exactly as they would have done in Europe and for
the same kind of music as far as their memory or their
supply of books carried them. That the latter, generally
speaking, cannot have been very large, goes without saying....
Instruments were to be found in the homes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>the wealthy merchants of the North and in the homes of
the still more pleasure seeking planters of the South.
Indeed, there can be little doubt that the nearest approach
to a musical atmosphere&#160;... was to be found in the
South rather than in the North. Still, we might call the
period until about 1720 the primitive period in our musical
history.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After 1720 we notice a steadily growing number of
musicians who sought their fortunes in the Colonies, an
increasing desire for organs, flutes, guitars, violins, harpsichords,
the establishment of ‘singing-schools,’ an improvement
in church music, the signs of a budding music
trade from ruled music paper to sonatas and concertos, the
advent of music engravers, publishers and manufacturers
of instruments, the tentative efforts to give English opera
a home in America, the introduction of public concerts, in
short the beginnings of what may properly be termed the
formative period in our musical history, running from 1720
until about 1800.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The first organ in America came from London in 1713 for
the Episcopal Church of Boston, but it remained unpacked
for seven months, as many objected to an organ at divine
services. The fate of music hung in the balance with the
Puritans but fortunately it won out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rev. James Lyon, a graduate of Princeton University,
“Patriot, preacher and psalmodist,” published in 1792 a
collection of psalms, anthems and hymns, called <cite>Urania</cite>,
to which he added a few of his own compositions and a
dozen or so pages of instructions for his singing-school
in Philadelphia. Other collections followed.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>William Billings</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>William Billings, born in Boston, in 1746, was one of
our first composers. He took his music seriously, was self-taught,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>and wrote his first music on leather with chalk, in
the tannery where he worked. He was queer and was
laughed at, but he was so sincere in his love of music that
he won friends who encouraged him to publish (in 1770)
a new psalm-book, <cite>The New England Psalm Singer, or
American Chorister</cite>. As singing-schools had been formed
to learn how to read and to sing the church music, the
time was ripe for more difficult music than had been allowed
by the Pilgrim Fathers. Billings, although he
knew nothing about it, tried some experiments in counterpoint,
and introduced some “fugue-tunes,” which really
were not fugues at all, into his hymns. That he enjoyed
the result may be seen from this quotation: “It has more
than twenty times the power of the old slow tunes, each
part straining for mastery and victory, the audience entertained
and delighted,&#160;... sometimes declaring for
one part, and sometimes for another. Now the solemn
bass demands their attention, next the manly tenor; now
the lofty counter, now the volatile treble. Now there;
now here again, O ecstatic! Rush on, you sons of harmony!”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the preface to his book we find the first American
musical declaration of independence, for he states that
Nature and not Knowledge must inspire thought, and that
“it is best for every composer to be his own carver.” But
later he showed a bigness of spirit, for he writes humbly:
“Kind Reader, no doubt you remember that about ten
years ago I published a book&#160;... and truly a most
masterly performance I then thought it to be. How lavish
was I of encomiums (praise) on this my infant production!...
I have discovered that many of the pieces
were not worth my printing or your inspection.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This second book was called <cite>Billings’ Best</cite> because it
became very popular. Many of his tunes were sung around
the camp-fires of the Revolutionary Army, and even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>Continental fifers played one of his airs. He was a fiery
patriot, and when Boston was occupied by the British, he
paraphrased the 137th Psalm, and wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By the rivers of Watertown, we sat down;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yea, we wept as we remembered Boston!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This was the time when the young Mozart was astonishing
the courts of Europe, and the Colossus Beethoven was
born!</p>

<p class='c008'>For a long time there was prejudice against instrumental
music in New England, so the first concerts gave selections
from Handel’s <cite>Messiah</cite> and Haydn’s <cite>Creation</cite>, which after
all were oratorios.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later William Billings’ singing class in Stoughton, Massachusetts,
founded in 1774 to study and perform psalm
tunes and oratorios became the Stoughton Musical Society
in 1786 and was looked upon as the earliest musical
organization in America. It is still in existence. But Mr.
Sonneck discovered that in Charleston, South Carolina,
the St. Cecilia Society was founded twenty-four years
earlier.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next important society founded was the Boston
Handel and Haydn. It is still alive and has had great
influence on musical life not only in its native city but
throughout America. After the war of 1812, a musical
jubilee was held in Boston. It was so successful, that a
society was formed from the fifty members of the Park
Street Church choir and others interested in “cultivating
and improving a correct taste in the performance of sacred
music.” This was the Handel and Haydn, which has
lived up to its intention. The young society showed
American spirit and asked Beethoven to write a work for
it! The Colossus was pleased with this recognition from
over the seas, and in one of his note books had written
“The oratorio for Boston.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Music in Benjamin Franklin’s Philadelphia</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Although New England was the cradle of music, Philadelphia
was the art center in the second half of the 18th
century, and went ahead of Boston in culture, because it
was not held down by Puritan laws. In 1741 Benjamin
Franklin published Dr. Watt’s hymns, and later invented
an instrument called the harmonica,—not the little mouthorgan.
Franklin’s instrument was a set of thirty-five circular
glasses arranged on a central rod, tuned to play
three octaves and enclosed in a case that looked like a
spinet. There is one in New York City at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. Try rubbing the edge of your tumbler
with a moist finger and you will hear the sound this
instrument made.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Goldsmith’s <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite>, we read that fashionable
ladies “would talk of nothing but&#160;... pictures,
taste, Shakespeare and the <i><span lang="it">musical glasses</span></i>.” These had
been invented by no less a person than Gluck! He played
a concerto on twenty-six drinking glasses, accompanied
with “the whole band,” and claimed he could play anything
that could be performed on a violin or harpsichord!
It was after hearing them in London, that Franklin improved
upon them and made his harmonica.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Francis Hopkinson, “First American Poet-Composer”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>On whom should fall the title of first American composer?
William Billings was born before Francis Hopkinson
(1757–1791), but in 1759, Hopkinson wrote a secular
song, <cite>My Days Have Been so Wondrous Free</cite>, eleven years
before Billings’ <cite>New England Psalm Singer</cite> saw the light
of day. Billings was the product of New England Psalmody,
was an uncouth self-taught son of the people.
Hopkinson was born in Philadelphia, was a college bred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>man, lawyer, poet, essayist, patriot, composer, harpsichord
player, organist, and inventor.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was an intimate friend of Franklin, Washington,
Jefferson and Joseph Bonaparte; a member of the Continental
Congress, and one of the signers of the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote in the style of Carey and Dr. Arne in England,
and we have eight songs dedicated to “His Excellency
George Washington, Esquire,” and in the dedication Hopkinson
says: “With respect to this work&#160;... I can only
say that it is such as a lover, not a master, of the arts can
furnish.”</p>

<p class='c008'><cite>The Beggar’s Opera</cite> was presented in New York in 1750
and in Philadelphia in 1759. In 1787, Washington went
to a puppet opera in Philadelphia. In 1801 selections from
Handel’s <cite>Messiah</cite> were given in the hall of the University
of Pennsylvania. We hear of Francis Hopkinson’s playing
on the first organ in Christ Church, Philadelphia, and
as early as 1749, John Beals, a “musick-master from
London” comes to the Quaker city to teach “violin, hautboy,
(oboe) flute and dulcimer,” and advertises as ready to
play for balls and entertainments. So we see Philadelphia
growing up rapidly, with opera, oratorio, instrumental
music and music teachers!</p>

<p class='c008'>Franklin and Washington often commented on the unusually
fine music that they heard in the town of Bethlehem
(Pennsylvania). Today the early appreciation of
music is continued in the yearly Bach Festival held in the
Moravian Church under the direction of Frederick Wolle.
Musicians from everywhere attend these remarkable performances
at Bethlehem.</p>

<p class='c008'>Trinity Church in New York had an organ in 1741,
although there were concerts at least ten years earlier.
An English schoolmaster, William Tuckey, was the first
to train choir boys for the services about 1756.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Early Opera</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We should hardly expect to find French and Italian
operas in America before the 1800s, but way down south
in New Orleans in 1791, a troupe was giving performances
of parts of operas and <em>vaudeville</em>, and perhaps an occasional
opera of Grétry or Boieldieu. From 1810, the company
performed opera regularly, and until recently, there
was French opera in New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every time an opera company came to New York, <cite>The
Beggar’s Opera</cite> was played, along with other <em>Ballad-Operas</em>.
In 1796, there were two operas by Americans, Benjamin
Carr and Pellisier, but all details have been lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Elson says, “At the beginning of the 19th century
Charleston and Baltimore entered the operatic field, and
travelling troupes came into existence, making short circuits
from New York through the three large cities, but
avoiding Boston, which was wholly given over to Handel,
Haydn, and psalms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The first time that New York heard <cite>Home, Sweet Home</cite>
was on November 12, 1823, in a melodrama by John
Howard Payne, <cite>Clari, the Maid of Milan</cite>. Payne, an
American, wrote the words, and Henry Carey, the English
composer, the music.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first grand opera that New York heard was Weber’s
<cite><span lang="de">Der Freischütz</span></cite>. It was probably a very crude performance
as they made many changes to suit public taste,
but it was a great success, especially the melodramatic
scenes.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1825, Manuel Garcia, a Spanish tenor, came to New
York with his family of singers, including his daughter,
who afterwards became the famous Mme. Malibran. He
gave <cite>The Barber of Seville</cite> and ten other Italian operas
which were a revelation to the new world. They called
Garcia the “Musical Columbus.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>After this, New York was never without some opera venture.
One company followed another, and although the
people seemed to enjoy the novelty for a while, they never
gave it whole-souled patronage.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first opera written (1845) by an American was
<cite>Leonora</cite> by William H. Fry (1813–1864). It was performed
in Philadelphia, and thirteen years later in New York. It
was in the Balfe and Donizetti style. He composed symphonies
and wrote for the New York <cite>Tribune</cite> on musical
subjects, and did much to make people realize the benefit
of music.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1855 George Bristow composed the second American
opera, <cite>Rip Van Winkle</cite>. He and Fry started a crusade
against the German musicians who had come over to
America after the revolution of 1848, fearing that they
would extinguish the feeble American flame of composing.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Orchestras</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The father of American orchestras was a German oboe
player, Gottlieb Graupner. When Haydn went to London
to direct the largest orchestra formed, up to that time,
Graupner played with him. Graupner went to Boston
(1799), and at once formed the first American orchestra.
About the same time in New York, a society called the “Euterpian”
was founded; it gave one concert a year for thirty
years! From 1820 to 1857 there was in Philadelphia, a
“Musical Fund Society”; its object was to improve musical
taste and to help needy musicians. It gave the first performance
in America of Beethoven’s <cite>First Symphony</cite>, as
well as choral works.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Boston the last concert of the Philharmonic Orchestra
as Graupner’s band was called, took place in 1824, and
another more important orchestra was formed sixteen
years later. Before the Boston Symphony came, an orchestra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>was given to the city by the Harvard Musical
Association. It was controlled by a group of people
brought up on Handel, Haydn and Beethoven, who would
not permit their idols to be replaced by such anarchists
as Berlioz and Wagner! Many of the young foreign orchestral
players wanted the new works by the “anarchists,”
so they seceded from the Harvard Musical Association
and called themselves the Philharmonic Society. As
there were not enough people interested in classical music
to support two orchestras they were soon replaced by the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, which was put on a permanent
basis by Colonel Henry L. Higginson, who founded
it and supported it during his lifetime. Georg Henschel
conducted the first concert in 1881, and the Boston Symphony
Orchestra has always been one of the greatest musical
institutions in America. The conductors have been
Wilhelm Gericke, Arthur Nikisch, Max Fiedler, Karl
Muck, Henri Rabaud, Pierre Monteux, and Serge Koussevitzky.</p>

<p class='c008'>The New York Philharmonic Society, born in 1842, was
founded through the efforts of a violinist, Uriah Hill, its
first conductor, and it always gave works of value. Among
its conductors have been: Theodore Thomas, Dr. Leopold
Damrosch, Anton Seidl, Walter Damrosch, Emil Paur,
Wassili Safonoff, Henry Hadley, Gustav Mahler, Theodore
Spiering, Josef Stransky, Willem Mengelberg, Willem van
Hoogstraten, Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Arturo Toscanini,
a genius among conductors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Theodore Thomas (1835–1905), who was born in Germany
but came to this country at the age of ten, was the
first great musician to live in America and to advance the
condition and standards. He gave this country its first
taste for the aristocrat of music, chamber music, and with
William Mason, the pianist, presented Schumann and
Brahms to America. They were young radicals, and wanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>to make everybody love the music they loved. Thomas
introduced Wagner, too, and can’t you imagine the discussions
the Wizard’s music raised when even Europe was
torn in its opinions of the master innovator? Franz Liszt
sent Thomas parts of the scores which the young conductor
tried out even before they had been played in Europe.
He had an orchestra of his own in 1864 that ran a close
race with the Philharmonic Society in New York, and he
took it out on tour, giving other cities the chance to hear
orchestral music. Theodore Thomas was a musical missionary!
In 1877 and 1879 he was conductor of the New
York Philharmonic, and in 1890 the Chicago Orchestra
was formed where he remained until his death in 1905.
Frederick Stock followed Thomas, and the Chicago Orchestra
has helped to cultivate music in the Middle West.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Damrosch Family</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In 1871, a German conductor, destined to develop music
came to New York and after a few months, sent for his
family. This was Dr. Leopold Damrosch, who founded
the Oratorio Society (1873), and the New York Symphony
Society (1877), which was merged with the Philharmonic
in 1928. The Oratorio Society, for many years directed
by Walter Damrosch, is today conducted by a gifted
American, Albert Stoessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the early years feeling ran high between the followers
of Theodore Thomas and Dr. Damrosch, and many
stories are told of the rivalry in playing new European
scores. One of Damrosch’s greatest early triumphs was
the performance of Berlioz’s <cite>Damnation of Faust</cite>. He also
gave the first performance of Brahms’ First Symphony.</p>

<p class='c008'>During this time, Dr. Damrosch’s young son, Walter,
was playing second violin, learning through experience,
his father’s profession, and he is today the conductor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>the New York Symphony Society, and a commanding figure
in America.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Damrosch was also a pioneer in introducing Wagner
to us. Two years after the Metropolitan Opera House was
built (1882), Dr. Damrosch was made director and conductor
of German opera. He imported some of the great
Wagnerian singers, Madame Materna, Marianne Brandt,
Mme. Seidl-Kraus, Anton Schott, and others. Wagner
opera had come to stay. After a short illness, Dr. Damrosch
died (1885) and his son Walter, then nineteen years
of age, fell heir to the position of conductor of German
opera at the Metropolitan Opera House, and of the Oratorio
Society. Through Walter Damrosch’s efforts, Lilli
Lehmann, the foremost Wagnerian singer, was engaged
for the Metropolitan; he also engaged Emil Fischer, basso,
Max Alvary, tenor, Anton Seidl, conductor, and Mme.
Lillian Nordica (Lillian Norton), one of the first Americans
at the Metropolitan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Walter Damrosch composed the popular American song,
<cite>Danny Deever</cite> on the poem by Rudyard Kipling. One
never can think of this stirring song, without remembering
David Bispham, who sang it into fame. Bispham was
another native, who was for years a member of the Metropolitan
Opera Company, and an oratorio singer. Damrosch
is the composer of two grand operas, <cite>The Scarlet
Letter</cite> on a text from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel, and
<cite>Cyrano de Bergerac</cite>, of Edmond Rostand’s, made into a
libretto by W. J. Henderson. He also wrote incidental
music to three Greek Tragedies <cite><span lang="la">Iphigenia in Aulis</span></cite>, <cite>Medea</cite>
and <cite>Electra</cite>, first performed in the open air theatre of the
University of California, in Berkeley, by Margaret Anglin
and her company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Damrosch married the daughter of James G. Blaine
in 1890, and soon after, he started an opera venture which
for several years visited the large cities and brought Wagner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>into many places where his music had been merely
a hearsay. He has been a pioneer in championing the
cause of modern composers, and many well known European
works have had their first American performances at
his New York Symphony concerts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Frank Damrosch, older brother of Walter, is an
important educator, the head of the Institute of Musical
Art, and was once conductor of the Oratorio Society, and
of the “Musical Art Society” in which were sung unaccompanied
all the lovely motets and madrigals of Palestrina,
Lassus, and many others. Dr. Frank Damrosch
also founded the People’s Choral Union in which working
men and women were taught singing and became members
of a chorus of twelve hundred voices which performed
the classic oratorios. He also founded the Young People’s
Concerts, which have brought to young people of New
York the finest music the world has produced. For
several years, Mr. Walter Damrosch has had these in
charge, and his talks explaining the works performed are
quite as enjoyable as the music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Mason Family</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Another famous family in American music is the Mason
family, dating back to Lowell Mason (1792–1872) who
was born at Medfield, Massachusetts. His principal work
was a collection of hymn tunes which he harmonized, and
won him the title of “Father of American Church Music.”
He was president and conductor of the Handel and Haydn
Society, and was a born teacher. He travelled from one
society to another in distant cities, training choruses, giving
encouragement and advice. He moved to New York
in 1851.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lowell Mason’s third son, Dr. William Mason (1829–1908),
was also a pioneer. In his long life he saw music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>grow in America from crude beginnings and reach a height
that seems almost unbelievable, in one short century. He
not only heard but played, piano concertos with orchestras
as fine as those he found in Europe when he went to study
with Moscheles, Hauptmann, Richter, and Franz Liszt.
Mason was one of the young artists permitted to be a
friend as well as a pupil of the kindly Music Master. Dr.
Mason and Theodore Thomas were the first to give chamber
music concerts, and thus introduced many masterpieces
of Brahms and Schumann, for as “modernists” they loved
to bring new compositions to the public. Dr. Mason in
his whole-hearted love of his art, and sincerity and geniality
is worthy of our deepest respect and admiration. He
composed about fifty piano pieces, and with W. S. B.
Mathews he arranged a piano method that was very popular
and successful. We feel sure that if you search in that
old box of music that mother used to study, you will find a
copy. No doubt she played his <cite>Silver Spring</cite>, <cite>Reverie
Poetique</cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">Danse Rustique</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Daniel Gregory Mason, one of the foremost composers,
lecturers and writers on music, is a nephew of Dr. William
Mason. He was born in 1873, was graduated from
Harvard University in 1895. His compositions include
many works in large form, sonatas, a string quartet on
Negro themes, a piano quartet, a symphony, a fugue for
piano and orchestra, a Russian Song Cycle, piano pieces;
Mr. Mason has written many valuable books on musical
subjects and on Music Appreciation, and is at present professor
of music at Columbia University.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Gottschalk—the Picturesque</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We have been telling you about the composers in the
northern part of the United States, and those who had
come from Germany like the Damrosch family, but here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>is one composer and gifted pianist who brought a new color
into American music. Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829–1869),
born in New Orleans, was the child of an English
father and Creole mother, thus mixing Spanish, French and
English blood. He was an infant prodigy; he played the
piano at four, the organ at six, and at thirteen he went to
Paris to study. He was praised by Chopin, and appeared
in concerts with Hector Berlioz. He charmed everyone
who heard him, and was the first American pianist to receive
European honors. The Infanta of Spain made a cake
for him and a celebrated bull-fighter gave him a sword!
He toured Cuba and North and South America, giving
more than a thousand concerts. But the life was too
hard on him and he died at the age of forty in Rio Janeiro,
Brazil.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite>The Last Hope</cite>, <cite><span lang="es">Ojos Creollos</span></cite> (<cite>Creole Eyes</cite>), <cite>Banjo</cite>, <cite>Souvenirs
of Andalusia</cite> are among the most popular of his
ninety compositions for piano, which showed the strong
influence of life in Louisiana, his love of sunshiny Spain, and
his study in France. Here we find rhythms closely related
to ragtime and jazz, as well as the slow fascinating Spanish
dance. Today his works are forgotten, but for many
years they were played throughout the land.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Stephen Collins Foster</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Stephen Collins Foster (1826–1864), for whom we have
claimed the right to be called a composer of folk songs, was
born in Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania, on the
fiftieth anniversary of our Declaration of Independence.
The understanding he showed of the Negro came to him
because his parents were Southerners. He showed talent
for music when he was very young, and taught himself to
play the flageolet when he was seven years old. He was
very self-willed and did not like discipline, so he taught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>himself practically all he knew of music. His first composition,
<cite>Tioga Waltz</cite> for four flutes, was written when
he was a school boy. It was first played in school, with
Stephen in the lead. His first song, <cite>Open thy Lattice,
Love</cite>, was published in 1842. For several years, five boys
met at the Foster home, and Stephen taught them to sing
part songs. He composed many pieces for them, among
them <cite>Oh, Susannah</cite>, <cite>Old Uncle Ned</cite> and <cite>Old Black Joe</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>About 1830, an actor, Thomas Rice, had the idea of
dressing up like an old negro porter in Pittsburgh, from
whom he borrowed the clothes, and singing a song he had
heard from a negro stage driver:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Turn about and wheel about, and do jist so,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ebery time I turn about, I jump Jim Crow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>The song, accompanied by a dance, took the audience by
storm, especially when the porter appeared on the stage,
half dressed, and demanded his clothes, because the whistle
of the steamboat had just blown and the old fellow had to
“get back on the job.” So “Daddy” Rice became the
father of “Negro Minstrels,” and travelled all over America
and even England, singing and dancing negro songs.
A few years later Stephen Foster sent his <cite>Oh, Susannah</cite> to
a travelling minstrel troupe, and the song took “like wild
fire.” He decided to write songs as a profession, in spite
of his family who thought he had wasted time “fooling
around” with music, and insisted on his going to work.</p>

<p class='c008'>While <cite>Oh, Susannah</cite> is a “rollicking jingle,” <cite>Old Uncle
Ned</cite> is the “first of the pathetic negro songs that set Foster
apart from his contemporaries and gave him a place in
musical history,” says Harold Vincent Milligan. “In
this type of song, universal in the appeal of its naïve pathos
he has never had an equal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another claim he has as a folk song composer, is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>he never studied as most people do who want to be composers.
He knew very little about harmony and less of counterpoint,
and his is “music that has come into existence
without the influence of conscious art, as a spontaneous
utterance, filled with characteristic expression of the feelings
of a people.” (H. E. Krehbiel.) Perhaps he was right
when he said that he was afraid that study would rob
him of the gift of spontaneous melody that was his to such
a marked degree, because he was not naturally a student
and might never have carried his studies far enough. At
any rate we have every reason to be grateful for the simple
direct songs which are dear to us and as near to our hearts
as any folk song of any age or country whose author has
been forgotten!</p>

<p class='c008'>He was sweet-natured, irresponsible, refined and sensitive,
but easily influenced. His publishers made $10,000
out of his songs, but he made little and spent much. He
married in 1850, but the union was not happy.</p>

<p class='c008'>During his last years spent in New York, he was poverty-stricken
and miserable, and sold his songs, as soon as they
were written, for a few dollars in order to live. It seems too
bad to have to say that much of his money and his life
were squandered thoughtlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Curiously enough, his favorite poet was Edgar Allan
Poe, whose life resembled his own in many sad details.
He loved to go up and down in the Broadway stages, often
thinking out his melodies as he rode. This reminds us of
Walt Whitman, who rode up and down Fifth Avenue alongside
his friend Pete Dooley, the driver of the stage coach!</p>

<p class='c008'>Stephen Foster died in New York in 1864 as the result
of an accident in which he had severed an artery. He was
saved from burial in Potter’s Field, by the arrival of his
brothers and his wife, and he was buried in Pittsburgh
beside his parents whom he had immortalized in <cite>The Old
Folks at Home</cite>.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXI<br> <span class='c016'>America Comes of Age</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>For many years Boston was a center of musical life.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the close of the Civil War a school was well under
way in New England, which we might call the classical
period of American music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>B. J. Lang</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Although Benjamin J. Lang (1837–1909) never published
his compositions and never allowed them to be heard,
he had much influence on Boston’s musical life, having
been conductor of the Handel and Haydn and of the St.
Cecilia societies, and the piano teacher of such musicians
as Arthur Foote, William Apthorp, Ethelbert Nevin and
Margaret Ruthven Lang, his daughter.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>John Knowles Paine</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>John Knowles Paine (1839–1906), was the first professor
of music at Harvard. In 1862, he gave his services
without pay for a course of lectures on music, but they
were not appreciated. When President Eliot became head
of the University, music was made part of the college curriculum
with Professor Paine at the head of the department.
In 1896, Walter R. Spalding was made assistant
and since Professor Paine’s death has been full professor.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>Professor Paine was the first American who wrote an
oratorio. <cite>St. Peter</cite> was performed in 1873 in Portland,
Maine, his birthplace. Next, he wrote two symphonies,
one of which was often played by Theodore Thomas.
Paine’s <cite>Centennial Hymn</cite> opened the Philadelphia Exhibition,
with more success than the Wagner March, it is said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Professor Paine was a pioneer in many fields of American
composition and taught American composers to follow
in the lines of sincerity and honesty which he carved
out for himself.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dudley Buck</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Dudley Buck (1839–1909), was a noted organist, composer
and teacher. He did not remain in New England
(Hartford, Connecticut) where he was born, but held
church positions in Chicago, Cincinnati, Brooklyn, and
New York, and was active in the musical life of these different
cities. His principal works were anthems and hymns,
still in use, music for the organ and valuable text-books,
also many popular cantatas.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>George Chadwick</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>George Chadwick, one of our most important composers,
was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1854. He studied
in Germany with Reinecke, Jadassohn and Rheinberger,
three celebrated teachers who had more to do with forming
the taste of the American composers than any <em>American</em>
teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chadwick comes of a musical family. His musical life
began as alto singer in a Lawrence church choir, where
later he blew the bellows of the organ, but soon was promoted
from blowing to playing it. He began composing
while in High School. He was a student at the New England
Conservatory, founded in 1867, but was not allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>to study with the idea of becoming a professional. When
he saw that he would receive no further help from his
father toward music-training, the young musician of
twenty-two went to Michigan for a year. He taught music,
conducted a chorus, gave organ recitals, saving enough
to study in Leipsic. Jadassohn told Louis Elson that
Chadwick was the most brilliant student in his class.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1880, Chadwick returned to Boston where he has
lived ever since. From 1880 he was first, teacher, then
musical director of the New England Conservatory. Some
of his pupils have become leaders in American music,—Horatio
Parker, Arthur Whiting, J. Wallace Goodrich
(organist), Henry K. Hadley and others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chadwick has composed more orchestral works than
any other American. A list of them includes three symphonies,
a sinfonietta, six overtures, three symphonic
sketches for orchestra, a lyric sacred opera, <cite>Judith</cite>, music
to the morality play <cite>Everywoman</cite>, much chamber music,
many choral works and about fifty songs, of which the best
known is perhaps <cite>Allah</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Arthur Foote</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Arthur Foote (1853) is one of the few prominent composers
whose training bears the label “made in America,”
for he never studied abroad. He was born in Salem,
Massachusetts, and worked with Stephen Emery, a prominent
theory teacher. Foote was graduated from Harvard
in 1874, where he studied music in Professor Paine’s department.
After organ study with B. J. Lang, Foote became
organist of the First Unitarian Church founded in 1630,
which post he filled from 1878 to 1910. This is doubtless
the longest record of an organist in one church in America.
Foote has been one of America’s finest teachers, and
has influenced many, not only by his teaching, but by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>broad-minded criticism. His harmony text-book, written
with Walter R. Spalding, is among the most valuable and
reliable in the musical world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Foote has written scholarly and beautiful chamber and
orchestral music which has placed him in the foremost
ranks of American composers, but he has won the hearts
of the entire English-speaking world by two little songs,
<cite>Irish Folk Song</cite> and <cite>I’m Wearing Awa’</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Horatio Parker</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Horatio Parker (1863–1919) inherited his talent from his
mother who played the organ in Newton, Massachusetts,
but she had a hard time interesting her son in music,
for he disliked it very much. But at fourteen he had a
change of heart going to the other extreme of having literally
to be dragged away from the instrument. He studied
with Emery and Chadwick, and then went to Germany
to work with Rheinberger. He was organist in several
churches and in 1894 was made professor of music at
Yale University where he remained until his death.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1894, his best known work was performed in Trinity
Church, New York. It is an oratorio, <cite><span lang="la">Hora Novissima</span></cite>
(<cite>The Last Hour</cite>), on the old Latin poem by Bernard de
Morlaix, with English translation by Parker’s mother
also the author of the librettos for two other of his oratorios.
<cite><span lang="la">Hora Novissima</span></cite>, one of America’s most important
works, has been performed many times, not only in America,
but it was the first American work given at the English
Worcester Festival. It was so successful that Dr.
Parker received the commission to write for another English
festival at Hereford, and he composed <cite>A Wanderer’s
Psalm</cite>. This was followed by <cite>The Legend of St. Christopher</cite>
which contains some of Parker’s most scholarly contrapuntal
writing for chorus. As another result of England’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>recognition of his music, Cambridge University conferred
upon the American composer the honorary degree of Doctor
of Music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Parker became famous for winning the prize of $10,000
offered by the Metropolitan Opera Company in 1911 for
the best opera by an American. This was <cite>Mona</cite>, a story
of the Druids in Britain, for which Brian Hooker, the American
poet, wrote the libretto. In spite of the work having
won the prize, it had no success with the public, and did
not outlive its first season.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1915 Parker and Hooker won another $10,000 prize
offered by the National Federation of Music Clubs, with
an opera called <cite>Fairyland</cite>. It has not seen the light of day
since its performances in Los Angeles.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Frederick Converse</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Frederick Converse (1871), like many other Boston
musicians, was graduated from Harvard (1893), when his
<cite>Opus I</cite>, a violin sonata, was publicly performed. After
study with Chadwick, he went to Germany to Rheinberger,
returning in 1898, with his first symphony under his arm.
He is now living in Boston. Converse has written many
orchestral and chamber music works, and has often set
Keats, the English poet, or used his writings as inspiration
for his music,—<cite>Festival of Pan</cite> and <cite>Endymion’s Narrative</cite>,
two symphonic poems, and <cite><span lang="fr">La Belle Dame sans
Merci</span></cite>, a ballad for baritone voice and orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Converse was the first of the present day Americans to
have had an opera <cite>The Pipe of Desire</cite> produced by the Metropolitan
Opera Company (1910).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Two College Professors</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>David Stanley Smith, a native of Toledo, Ohio (1877),
belongs to this New England group, for he was graduated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>from Yale University and since 1903 has been, first, instructor
in the music department and later full professor.
He has composed some excellent chamber music, and several
of his string quartets were played by the famous
Kneisel Quartet (1886–1917) which organization has had
a generous share in improving musical taste in this country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Edward Burlingame Hill, born in Cambridge, Massachusetts
(1872), is one of the professors of music at Harvard
University. He has composed piano pieces, songs,
and orchestral works, and has written many articles on
music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mrs. H. H. A. Beach Prepares the Path for American Women</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the most important composers of the New England
group, is Mrs. H. H. A. Beach (1867). She was Amy
Marcy Cheney, an astonishing little child who before her
second year sang forty tunes. Louis Elson tells that at
the age of two she was taken to a photographer, and just
as he was about to take the picture, she sang at the top of
her voice, <cite>See, the Conquering Hero Comes!</cite> She could
improvise like the old classic masters, and could transpose
Bach fugues from one key to another, at fourteen. When
sixteen, she made her début as a pianist, and at seventeen
she played piano concertos with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, also with Theodore Thomas’ orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Beach received her training in America. Her first
work in large form was a mass sung in 1892 by the Handel
and Haydn Society. She next composed a <em>scena</em> and <em>aria</em>
for contralto and orchestra, sung with the New York Symphony
Society. It was the first work by a woman and an
American to be given at these concerts, which Walter
Damrosch conducted.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>The next year, Mrs. Beach was invited to write a work
for the opening of the woman’s building at the Chicago
Columbian World’s Exposition. She has two piano concertos
and a symphony (<cite>The Gaelic</cite>) to her credit, also a
violin sonata, a quintet for flute and strings, many piano
pieces and splendid songs among which must be mentioned
<cite>The Year’s at the Spring</cite>, <cite>June</cite>, and <cite>Ah, Love, but a
Day</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Beach prepared the way for other American women,
not only by showing that women could write seriously in
big forms, but also by her sympathetic encouragement of
talent and sincerity wherever she finds it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Margaret Ruthven Lang (1867), daughter of B. J. Lang,
is also a Boston composer. <cite>Irish Mother’s Lullaby</cite> is the
best known of her many art songs, in addition to which
she has written an orchestral <cite>Dramatic Overture</cite> which
Arthur Nikisch played, when he was conductor of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among our best song writers are many women:—Harriet
Ware, Gena Branscombe, Alice Barnett, Fay Foster,
Eleanor Freer, Mana Zucca (who has written also a piano
concerto, and piano pieces), Rhea Silberta, Ethel Glenn Hier
(piano pieces and songs), Fannie Dillon (piano pieces and
violin compositions), Mabel Wood Hill (songs, chamber
music and an arrangement of two preludes and fugues of
Bach for string orchestra), Lilly Strickland, Mabel Daniels,
Katherine Ruth Heyman (songs, many of them in old
Greek modes, and a book, <cite>Relation of Ultramodern Music
to the Archaic</cite>), Rosalie Housman (songs, piano pieces and
a complete Hebrew Temple Service), Gertrude Ross, Mary
Turner Salter, Florence Parr Gere and Pearl Curran, writer
of several popular successes. And although she is not a composer
of art songs, we must not forget Carrie Jacobs Bond,
whose <cite>End of a Perfect Day</cite> has sold in the millions, and her
songs for little children have brought joy to many.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>One of Our Most Scholarly Musicians</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Another Boston musician and composer, teacher of
piano and composition is Arthur Whiting (1861), nephew of
the organist and composer George Whiting. He has made
a specialty of harpsichord music, and plays charmingly on
the little old instrument. Since 1895, he has lived in New
York City.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Charles Martin Loeffler—First Impressionist in America</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Charles Martin Loeffler is a composer belonging to a different
class from any of the Boston group just mentioned.
Loeffler is French by birth, as he was born in Alsace in
1861, French in his musical training and in his musical
sympathies. For forty-two years he has lived in Boston,
twenty of them at the second desk (next to the concertmaster)
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was the
first composer to write in this country, the kind of music
that existed at the end of the 19th century in France,—the
music of Fauré, Dukas, Chausson and Debussy. The
seed he planted did not fall on fertile soil, for all his fellow
musicians as well as the orchestral conductors, from whose
hands the public received its music, were Germans and
German trained. They knew their “three B’s,” their
Wagner and even the French Berlioz, but Loeffler brought
something different, something disturbing, and was not
easy to place. His music belonged neither to the classical
nor to the romantic school.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only in America did this new French music have
a fight, but on its own ground in France was it misunderstood!
But you have seen from Monteverde to
Wagner that the path of true innovation never ran
smooth!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>Loeffler’s work is original, the work of a musician completely
master of the modern orchestra and of modern harmony
with its colorful and expressive effects. Besides
this there was a spirit that never before had come into art.
This was given the name of Impressionism, the getting of
effects from objects, painted, or described in literature,
without elaborate details. In music, composers who try
to suggest to the hearer an image existing in their own
minds are called Impressionists. This image may be a
thought, an emotion, a definite object, a poem, a picture, a
beautiful tree, the grandeur of Niagara, any one of a thousand
things that await the hand of the Alchemist-Musician
to be transmuted into tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>All Loeffler’s compositions reflect this impressionism,
and he was the first, but not the last of these poetic tone
impressionists in America. He is foremost a composer of
symphonic poems: <cite><span lang="fr">La Mort de Tintagiles</span></cite> (<cite>The Death of
Tintagiles</cite>) after the play by Maurice Maeterlinck, <cite>A
Pagan Poem</cite> after Virgil, <cite><span lang="fr">La Bonne Chanson</span></cite> (<cite>The Good
Song</cite>) after Verlaine, <cite><span lang="fr">La Vilanelle du Diable</span></cite>, <cite>The Mystic
Hour</cite> with male chorus, <cite>Psalm 137</cite> with female chorus.
He also wrote an eight part mixed chorus, <cite>For One who
Fell in Battle</cite>. Other orchestral works include a suite in
four movements for violin and orchestra called <cite><span lang="fr">Les Veillées
de l’Ukraine</span></cite> (<cite>Evening Tales of the Ukraine</cite>), concerto for
’cello and orchestra, first played by Alwyn Schroeder with
the Boston Symphony Orchestra, <cite><span lang="fr">Divertissement</span></cite> for violin
and orchestra, and <cite><span lang="fr">Spanish Divertissement</span></cite> for saxophone
and orchestra. There are also important works for chamber
music: two rhapsodies for clarinet, viola and piano, an
octet for strings and two clarinets, a quintet and a quartet
built on Gregorian modes; and he has written a group
of songs for medium voice and viola obligato with French
texts by Verlaine and Beaudelaire, two impressionist
poets.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Red Man Attracts Composers</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The next composer, Henry F. Gilbert, born in Somerville,
Massachusetts (1868), brings us into an interesting
field, the study of Negro and Indian folk music. After
working with Edward MacDowell, Gilbert turned his
attention to a thorough investigation of Negro music,
resulting in orchestral works based on Negro themes
such as, <cite>American Humoresque</cite>, <cite>Comedy Overture on Negro
Themes</cite>, <cite>American Dances</cite>, <cite>Negro Rhapsody</cite>, and <cite>The Dance
in Place Congo</cite>, a symphonic poem which was mounted as
a ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House (1918).</p>

<p class='c008'>Gilbert tells that the <cite>Comedy Overture</cite> was rescued from
a wreck that was to have been a Negro Opera, based on
Joel Chandler Harris’ <cite>Uncle Remus</cite>. What a pity he did
not complete it!</p>

<p class='c008'>The <cite>American Humoresque</cite> is based on old Negro minstrel
tunes like <cite>Zip Coon</cite>, <cite>Dixie</cite>, and <cite>Old Folks at Home</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gilbert was one of the founders of the Wa-Wan Press,
established at Newton Center, Massachusetts, by Arthur
Farwell. It was organized (1901) by composers in the
interest of American compositions, and to study and encourage
the use of Indian music. He died in 1928.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arthur Farwell was born in St. Paul, Minnesota (1872).
He attended college in Boston and studied music with
Homer Norris (1860–1920), a Boston organist and composer,
whose cantata <cite>Flight of the Eagle</cite> was based on a Walt
Whitman poem. Farwell was also a pupil of Humperdinck
in Berlin and Guilmant in Paris. The Indian music research,
in which he is a pioneer, led him into the West to
live among the Redskins and to make phonograph records
of hundreds of tunes. He is also interested in community
singing and music for the people. Practically a
new field is his music for Percy MacKaye’s pageants <cite>Caliban</cite>
and <cite>The Evergreen Tree</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>Carlos Troyer, a very old Californian who died recently,
spent his life collecting Zuni and Mojave-Apache songs,
having realized their artistic value long before any one else.
In his youth he was an intimate friend of Liszt. He travelled,
later, through South American jungles, with his
violin and music paper, writing down the tunes he heard,
and several times he would have been burned by the savages,
but saved himself by playing for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harvey Worthington Loomis contributed a piano version
of Omaha Indian melodies to the Wa-Wan Press (1904)
called <cite>Lyrics of the Redman</cite>. In the preface Loomis shows
that Indian themes should be used impressionistically, for
he says: “If we would picture the music of the wigwam
and the war-path we must aim by means of the imagination
to create an art work that will project, not by <em>imitation</em>
but by <em>suggestion</em>, the impression we have ourselves received
in listening to this weird savage symphony in its pastoral
<em>entourage</em> (surroundings) which, above all, makes the Indian’s
music sweet to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Natalie Curtis’ valuable service to Indian and Negro
music was cut off by her tragic death in Paris (1921), from
an automobile accident. Fortunately she left several works
in which she gave not only information on the music of
these primitive Americans and also the <cite>Songs and Tales
of the Dark Continent of Africa</cite>, but in them she set down
quite unconsciously the beauty of her character and the
sincerity of her purpose. There are four volumes of Negro
Folk Songs, and <cite>The Indians’ Book</cite>, besides the African
book. Recently we heard two Spanish-Indian melodies, a
<cite>Crucifixion Hymn</cite> and <cite>Blood of Christ</cite>, that Miss Curtis
found in use in religious festivals near Santa Fe, New Mexico.
They are Spanish in character, and are almost unaltered
examples of the songs of the Middle Ages brought
down to us by the Indian. These were arranged by Percy
Grainger according to directions left by Miss Curtis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>Several American operas have been written on Indian
legends and it would be difficult to find more picturesque
subjects.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Our Light Opera Genius</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Victor Herbert’s <cite>Natoma</cite>, given by the Chicago Opera
Company in 1911, is an Indian story and one of his two
grand operas. Born in Dublin, Ireland (1854), Herbert
was the grandson of the novelist Samuel Lover. He was
educated in Germany, and was a fine ’cellist. He came to
the Metropolitan Opera orchestra as first ’cellist in 1886,
and since then until his death in 1924, he delighted every
one with his incomparable melodies in light operas.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Patrick Gilmore’s death, Herbert in 1893, became
bandmaster of the 22nd Regiment band which had become
famous in 1869 and 1872 for two monster Peace Jubilees
held in Boston. We think the 20th century, the age of
gigantic enterprises, but——! for the first Jubilee, Gilmore
had a chorus of 10,000 voices, and a band of 1,000! Not
satisfied with this volume, in the second Jubilee he doubled
the number! He also had cannons fired to increase the
drum battery!</p>

<p class='c008'>From Gilmore’s Band, Herbert became conductor of
the Pittsburgh Symphony, also guest conductor of the New
York Philharmonic Orchestra, but he had made such a
success as composer of light operas, that he finally devoted
all his time to the theater. Among Herbert’s most popular
successes are: <cite>The Serenade</cite>, <cite>The Idol’s Eye</cite>, <cite>Babes in Toyland</cite>,
<cite><span lang="fr">Mlle. Modiste</span></cite>, <cite>Naughty Marietta</cite>, <cite>The Madcap Duchess</cite>,
etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Julian Edwards (1855–1910), like Victor Herbert was
born a British subject, in Manchester, England, and was a
successful composer of light opera. He also wrote many
sacred cantatas.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sousa, the March King</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Our most famous bandmaster is America’s “March
King,” John Philip Sousa (1856), once leader of the United
States Marine Band. Who has not marched to <cite>Stars and
Stripes Forever</cite>, <cite>Washington Post</cite>, or <cite>Liberty Bell</cite>? Who
does not love them, be he “high” or “low brow”? With
Sousa leading, the band has played around the world, and
no American composer is better known abroad. In fact,
Sousa’s music was considered as “typically American”
twenty years ago as is jazz today.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Another Indian Opera</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Now for the Redskins again! Charles Wakefield Cadman’s
Indian opera <cite>Shanewis</cite> was given at the Metropolitan
Opera House in 1918. Cadman is well known for many
songs which have become popular, <cite>At Dawning</cite> and <cite>The
Land of the Sky-blue Water</cite>, a lovely Indian song. Born in
Johnstown, Pennsylvania (1881), Cadman received musical
training in Pittsburgh. For some years he has been living
in California.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another Pennsylvanian, who spent several years among
the Indians, studying their music and using genuine themes
for his opera <cite>Poia</cite> is Arthur Nevin (1871), younger brother
of Ethelbert Nevin. For several years he was professor
of music at the University of Kansas.</p>

<p class='c008'>A professor at the same college is Charles Sanford Skilton
(1868), writer of many cantatas and orchestral Indian
dances.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thurlow Lieurance (1897), one of the latest recruits to
Indian music lore, is so well known for <cite>By the Waters of
Minnetonka</cite> that we almost forget other songs and a music
drama in which he has used Indian themes tellingly.
One of these is a Navajo blanket song.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>The blankets woven by the Navajo women are not only
remarkable examples of primitive art, but tell the stories
of the tribe. No two blankets are the same, and like the
music we write, are expressions of the weaver’s hopes,
fears, joys and sorrows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Homer Grunn (1880) who taught piano in Phoenix,
Arizona, profited by the opportunity to gather Indian
tunes, which he has put into songs, a music drama and
orchestral works.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ethelbert Nevin—Poet-Composer</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Ethelbert Nevin (1862–1901) told his father that he
would not mind being poor all his life if he could just be a
musician! And the father, a music lover himself, allowed
his sensitive, dream-loving, poetic son to study in America
and in Europe. Perhaps “Bert’s” mother had something
to do with the decision, for she, too, was sensitive and fine,
and so much of a musician that her grand piano was the
first to cross the Allegheny mountains into Edgeworth,
the town near Pittsburgh where the Nevins were born.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ethelbert Nevin was a romanticist who found the
medium of his expression in short songs and piano pieces.
He had a gift of melody surpassed by few and he reached
the heart as perhaps no other American except Stephen
Foster had done. <cite>Narcissus</cite> for piano and <cite>The Rosary</cite>
have swept through this country selling in the millions.
<cite>Mighty Lak’ a Rose</cite>, published after his early death, was a
close third. Several others of his songs may be ranked
among the best that America has produced. Nevin was
what Walt Whitman would have called a “Sweet Singer.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Robin Hood and His Merrie Crew Come to Life in the 19th Century</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Reginald de Koven (1859–1920) will ever be remembered
for his delightful light opera <cite>Robin Hood</cite> on which we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>brought up. His song, <cite>Oh, Promise Me</cite>, will probably be
sung when he will have been forgotten. De Koven’s last
two works were operas, of which <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite> after
Chaucer was performed at the Metropolitan Opera House
and <cite>Rip Van Winkle</cite> from Washington Irving and Percy
Mackaye, by the Chicago Opera Company. One of his
best songs is a setting of Kipling’s <cite>Recessional</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>“Pilgrim’s Progress”—An American Oratorio</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the most respected American composers is Edgar
Stillman Kelley, born in Sparta, Wisconsin, in 1857, whose
American forefathers date back to 1650. After study in
Stuttgart, Kelley went to California, where he was composer,
teacher, critic, lecturer, writer and light opera conductor.
Later he was professor at Yale, dean of composition
at the Cincinnati Conservatory, and since 1910, a
fellowship at the Western College at Oxford, Ohio, gives
him the leisure and economic freedom to compose. His
orchestral works include incidental music to <cite>Ben Hur</cite>,
<cite>Aladdin</cite>, Chinese suite, a comic opera, <cite>Puritania</cite>, <cite>Alice in
Wonderland</cite>, two symphonies, <cite>Gulliver</cite> and <cite>New England</cite>,
incidental music to <cite>Prometheus Bound</cite>, and an oratorio
based on Bunyan’s <cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>. If you do not
know Kelley’s delightful song, <cite>The Lady Picking Mulberries</cite>,
allow us to introduce the little Chinawoman to
you. You will meet at the same time an old acquaintance,—Mr.
Pentatonic Scale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several of the older school of composers in America,
faithful pioneers whose works are rarely heard now were
Silas G. Pratt (1846–1916); Frederic Grant Gleason (1848–1903),
who lived and worked in Chicago from 1877 to the
time of his death; William Wallace Gilchrist (1846–1916),
a writer of cantatas and psalms, Episcopal church music,
two symphonies, chamber music and songs, who spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>most of his life in Philadelphia; Homer N. Bartlett (1846–1920),
composer of piano pieces; William Neidlinger (1863–1924),
writer of many charming children’s songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank van der Stucken (1858) who was born in Texas,
but lived in Europe from 1866 until 1884, was the first
conductor to give an entire program of American orchestral
works in America and also at the Paris Exposition of
1889. For years he was conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony
Orchestra and he has composed many large orchestral
works. He died abroad in 1929.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosseter Gleason Cole (1866), composer of songs, piano
pieces, organ pieces, cantatas and works for orchestra and
’cello, takes his themes from American and general sources.
He is organist in Chicago and has charge of the music
courses of the summer session of Columbia University.
He has held many important posts and taken numerous
prizes. His cantata <cite>The Rock of Liberty</cite> was sung at the
Tercentenary Celebration, 1920, of the settlement of
Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arne Oldberg, born in Youngstown, Ohio (1874) is
director of the piano department of Northwestern University
(Michigan) and has many orchestral works, written
symphonies, concertos and overtures, which have had
frequent hearings. He has also composed much chamber
music.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are also Harry Rowe Shelley (1858), writer of much
important church music; James H. Rogers, composer of
teaching pieces for the piano and many fine songs, including
a cycle <cite><span lang="la">In Memoriam</span></cite>, which is a heartfelt expression
of sorrow in beautiful music; Wilson G. Smith, composer
of many piano teaching pieces and musical writer; Louis
Coerne, writer of opera and of works for orchestra; Ernest
Kroeger of St. Louis who also used Indian and Negro
themes in works for orchestra and piano; Carl Busch of
Kansas City, composer of orchestral works, cantatas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>music for violin and many songs, in some of which we
see the Indian. In California we meet Wm. J. McCoy and
Humphrey J. Stewart who have composed church music
and have written often for the yearly out-door “High
Jinks” of the San Francisco Bohemian Club, in which
many important composers have been invited to assist;
Domenico Brescia, a South American composer living in
San Francisco, who wrote interesting chamber music
played at the Berkshire Chamber Music Festivals; and
Albert Elkus, a composer of serious works for orchestra and
piano. Smith died in 1929; Coerne in 1922.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this is growing into a musical directory! And even
neglecting many who have done much to make music grow
in America, we must proceed for we have important milestones
ahead.</p>

<p class='c008'>For many years New York has been the American center
of music. Few of the people in musical life are native
New Yorkers, but have come from all parts of the States
and Europe to this musical Mecca.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>MacDowell Greatest American Poet-Composer</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The greatest romanticist and poet-composer of America
up to the present is Edward MacDowell (1861–1908).
Some of the romanticism of the early 19th century has
become mere imitation of the style which arose as a protest
against the insincere forms of the 18th century. But
the true spirit of romance never dies and never becomes
artificial,—such romance had MacDowell. He was sincere,
always a poet, always himself, and in spite of his
Irish-Scotch inheritance, German training and love of
Norse legends, he expressed MacDowell in every note. He
lived before the time when we question “How shall we
express America in Music”? In fact he was much against
tagging composers as American, German, French, and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>Edward MacDowell, born in New York City, began
piano lessons when he was eight. One of his teachers was
the brilliant South American Teresa Carreño, who later
played her pupil’s concerto with many world orchestras.
At 15, he entered the Paris Conservatory where he was
fellow student with Debussy.</p>

<p class='c008'>While there, MacDowell studied French, and during a
lesson amused himself by drawing a picture of his teacher.
When caught, the teacher, instead of rebuking him, took
the sketch to a friend, a master at the <i><span lang="fr">École des Beaux
Arts</span></i>, the famous old art school of Paris. The artist found
the sketch so good that he offered to train him without
charge but Edward had made up his mind to be a musician
and did not accept the offer.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1879, MacDowell studied composition at Frankfort
with Joachim Raff, one of the composers of the Romantic
period. Raff introduced him to Liszt, who invited MacDowell
to play his first piano suite at Zürich (1882). The
composer’s modesty is reflected in these words which
Lawrence Gilman quotes: “I would not have changed a
note in one of them for untold gold, and <em>inside</em> I had the
greatest love for them; but the idea that any one else
might take them seriously had never occurred to me.”
This suite was his first published composition.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1884, he married Miss Marian Nevins of New York,
and theirs was one of the most beautiful marriages in musical
history, although their meeting was amusing! The
young girl had crossed the ocean to continue her music
studies at a time when it was not a common occurrence,
and when she went to Raff for lessons, he sent her to a young
countryman of hers, “an extraordinary piano teacher.”
She was indignant to be sent to a young inexperienced
American in that fashion, but she went! The young
inexperienced American did not want to teach an American
girl, because he felt she would not be serious enough to do
the kind of work he demanded, but he accepted her! Later
she accepted him!</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>In 1888, he established himself in Boston as pianist and
teacher. His first concert was with the Kneisel Quartet,
and in 1889 he successfully played his concerto with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. He made tours through the
States giving recitals and appearing with the orchestras.
Winning immediate recognition, his position as an exceptional
composer grew. In 1896 the Boston Symphony
Orchestra presented his first piano concerto and his orchestral
<cite>Indian Suite</cite> on the same program in New York.
Such an honor had never before been shown an American!</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1896, he became professor of the new Chair of Music
at Columbia University in New York City. After resigning
his post in 1904, his health broke as the result of an
accident, and for several years he was an invalid. All the
care of physicians, devoted friends, his parents, and his
courageous wife, could not restore his memory, and in
1908, he died in New York and was buried in Peterboro,
N. H. A natural boulder from where he often watched
the sunset, marks the spot—fitting for one who loved
Nature as he did.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly before his passing, a group of friends formed a
society, the MacDowell Club of New York, which has for
its object the promoting of “a sympathetic understanding
of the correlation of all the arts, and of contributing to the
broadening of their influence, thus carrying forward the
life-purpose of Edward MacDowell.” He wished musicians
to know the value of associating with artists outside of the
field of music. Eugene Heffley, (1862–1925) an intimate
friend of MacDowell and first president of the MacDowell
Club did much to make the MacDowell music known and
loved, just as he did for Charles Griffes, Debussy, Ravel,
Scriabin and others who have come with new messages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some people have statues erected, others have towns and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>streets named for them, but besides the numerous MacDowell
Clubs throughout the States, the most beautiful
memorial is the MacDowell Association at Peterboro.
Early in his career, MacDowell found it impossible to work
well in the city, and by happy chance he and his wife discovered
a deserted farm which they bought for the proverbial
“song.” Here the composer spent his summers in
the beautiful New Hampshire woods, in the heart of which
he built the little log cabin, which in his words, is</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A house of dreams untold</div>
      <div class='line'>It looks out over the whispering tree-tops</div>
      <div class='line'>And faces the setting sun.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>And in this “house” he told many of his dreams in lovely
melody! While ill, he often expressed the desire to share
the inspiration-giving peace and beauty of his woods with
friends, workers in music and the sister arts. Out of this
wish has grown the colony for creative workers, which has
been a haven to hundreds of composers, poets, painters,
sculptors, dramatists, and novelists. The “Log Cabin”
is the seed out of which twenty studios have sprung. The
small deserted farm has spread over 500 acres, and Mrs.
MacDowell with the aid of faithful friends has made a
dream come true!</p>

<p class='c008'>MacDowell was a composer for the pianoforte, although
he wrote some lovely songs; a few orchestral works, best
known of which is <cite>The Indian Suite</cite>, in which he employs
Indian themes; and several male choruses written when he
conducted the New York Mendelssohn Glee Club. We
love and remember him for his <cite>Woodland Sketches</cite>, <cite>Sea
Pieces</cite>, <cite>Fireside Tales</cite>, <cite>New England Idyls</cite> (opus 62 and his
last work), virtuoso-studies, and the four sonatas—the
<cite><span lang="it">Tragica</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="it">Eroica</span></cite>, <cite>Norse</cite> and <cite>Keltic</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>W. H. Humiston (1869–1924), composer, lecturer, musical
critic, organist, assistant conductor of the New York
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>Philharmonic Orchestra and a pupil of MacDowell, had
the most complete collection of Bach and Wagner in this
country and was a great authority on their writings. This
collection now belongs to the MacDowell Association, and
is in the colony library at Peterboro.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Henry Holden Huss</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Henry Holden Huss (1862), born in Newark, New Jersey,
has lived in New York since his early twenties when he
returned from studying with Rheinberger in Munich.
Before his European days he was a pupil of his father,
George J. Huss, a Bavarian who came to America during
the 1848 revolution, and was one of the best musical educators
in this country. Huss also studied with O. B. Boise
(1845–1912), an American theorist and teacher. As concert
pianist, Huss has played his piano concerto, one of
the best American works, with all the important orchestras.
Raoul Pugno, the much-loved French pianist, and
Adele aus der Ohe also played it abroad and in America.</p>

<p class='c008'>Huss has always aimed for the highest ideals as teacher,
composer and pianist. A classicist at heart, his works are
written on classic models,—a beautiful violin sonata with
poetic slow movement, many chamber music works, a
concerto for violin and orchestra, besides <cite>The Seven Ages
of Man</cite> for baritone and orchestra, often sung by the late
David Bispham, <cite>Cleopatra’s Death</cite>, for soprano and orchestra,
a female chorus <cite>Ave Maria</cite>, and many fine art songs
and piano pieces, the most beautiful of which is a tone poem
<cite>To the Night</cite>, a lovely impressionistic composition that
ranks with the best that America has produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two other pupils of O. B. Boise, Ernest Hutcheson (1871)
an Australian, and Howard Brockway (1870), a Brooklynite,
have done much to make music grow in America. Hutcheson,
who studied also with Max Vogrich in Australia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>and Reinecke in Leipsic, has made so enviable a career as
pianist and teacher, that one forgets he has a symphony,
a double piano concerto and several other large works in
manuscript. Brockway, who harmonized <cite>Lonesome Tunes</cite>,
folk songs from the Kentucky Mountains collected by
Miss Loraine Wyman, is also the composer of a symphony
played in Boston (1907) by the Symphony Orchestra, a
suite, ballad-scherzo for orchestra, many piano works and
songs. Hutcheson, Brockway and Boise were teachers in
the Baltimore Peabody Institute, one of the important
music schools, under direction of Harold Randolph, a fine
musician and pianist.</p>

<p class='c008'>George F. Boyle (1886) of New South Wales has, since
1910, been professor at the Peabody Institute. He has
composed many piano pieces, songs and orchestral works.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Rubin Goldmark</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Rubin Goldmark (1872), is known as the best toastmaster
in the music world! Born in New York, he was
one of Dvorak’s most talented pupils and inherits his gifts
from his noted uncle Carl Goldmark (1830–1915), a Hungarian
composer of the overture <cite>Sakuntala</cite> and the opera
<cite>The Queen of Sheba</cite>, the symphony <cite>The Rustic Wedding</cite>
and much else. Rubin Goldmark has written several important
tone poems,—<cite>Samson</cite>, <cite>Gettysburg Requiem</cite>, <cite>Negro
Rhapsody</cite>, based on negro themes, and other fine things
for orchestra, chamber music, piano and violin numbers
and as a teacher he has laid the foundations for several
American composers among whom are:—Frederick Jacobi,
Aaron Copland and George Gershwin. Each score from
Goldmark’s pen is an addition to American music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Henry Hadley</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Henry K. Hadley (1871) by right of birth and training
belongs to the New England group of composers, but most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>of his life was spent in Germany where he got his orchestral
experience, and in different parts of America where he
has conducted orchestras—Seattle, Washington, San Francisco
and New York. Hadley is one of the few Americans
who has conducted the New York Philharmonic
Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hadley has taken many prizes for opera, symphony,
cantata and an orchestral rhapsody. To this he has added
numerous other orchestral and chamber music works and
over 100 songs.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Albert Mildenberg’s “Michael Angelo”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In these days when the cry is for American opera, it
seems regrettable that an opera ready for production should
lie idle because of the death of its composer. Perhaps no
work in history has had a more tragic story than <cite>Michael
Angelo</cite> by Albert Mildenberg (1878–1918). In 1908, Mildenberg
signed a contract in Vienna for the production of
the opera. The following year on the way to Europe, the
ship, <em>Slavonia</em>, was wrecked, and although the composer
escaped, his entire orchestral score and parts went to the
bottom of the sea. Courageously he rewrote the work, and
sent it to the Metropolitan Opera House in competition
for the $10,000 prize, won by Horatio Parker. Before it
had reached the judges, in some way, still unexplained,
the major part of the score disappeared! Again, Mildenberg
set to work with the sketches he had, and made a
third score, but it cost him his life, for though the opera
was completed before his death, he was too ill to carry it
further.</p>

<p class='c008'>In addition to this grand opera, Mildenberg, a pupil of
Rafael Joseffy, wrote many piano pieces. He also composed
<cite>The Violet</cite>, <cite>I Love Thee</cite>, and <cite>Astarte</cite>, songs that had
a popular vogue and are still found on many programs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>and romantic comic operas, <cite>The Wood Witch</cite> and <cite>Love’s
Locksmith</cite>, besides a cantata and many choruses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two other operas which had Metropolitan Opera House
productions were <cite>The Temple Dancer</cite> by John Adam Hugo
(1873) and <cite>The Legend</cite> by Joseph Carl Breil (1870).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>John Alden Carpenter—Modernist</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>John Alden Carpenter (1876), one of America’s foremost
composers, was born in Park Ridge, Illinois, and educated
at Harvard where he took the music course, studying afterwards
in England with Edward Elgar, the English composer.
A business man, Carpenter still devotes his time to
composing music that has put him among America’s leading
musical lights. While he might be called a romanticist,
his tendencies are impressionistic, and none understands
better than he the charms of rich and unusual harmonies,
the use of modern melodic and orchestral effects, and the
value of humor in music. All these we find in his <cite>Adventures
in a Perambulator</cite> for orchestra, and his ballet <cite>Krazy
Kat</cite>, where jazz rhythms are used to great advantage. One
of the most beautiful works of its kind, is the ballet after
Oscar Wilde’s <cite>The Birthday of the Infanta</cite>, performed by
the Chicago Opera Company, and his first ballet written
for the Metropolitan Opera Company is called <cite>Skyscraper</cite>,
certainly American! Carpenter’s settings of Tagore’s
<cite>Gitanjali</cite> are among America’s finest songs; he has many
others, a concertino for piano and orchestra and a violin
sonata.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>An All-American Symphony</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Eric Delamarter (1880), born in Lansing, Michigan, has
written a <cite>Symphony After Walt Whitman</cite> in which he has
used twenty-year old street songs from the “Barbary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>Coast” (San Francisco Bowery), <cite>Lonesome Tunes</cite> of Kentucky,
and a fox-trot rhythm with newer street songs.
These, Delamarter has woven into a symphony with skill
and sincerity. The material is All-American although
neither Negro nor Indian.</p>

<p class='c008'>Delamarter is a well-known musical critic in Chicago,
an organist, composer of many other works for orchestra,
organ, and oratorios, incidental music for drama, cantatas
and songs and since 1917 assistant conductor of the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Noble Kreider and Edward Royce, son of Professor
Josiah Royce of Harvard University, have both written
well for the piano. Harold Bauer has played variations
and short pieces by Edward Royce.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ernest Schelling—Pianist-Composer</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Ernest Schelling (1876), born in Delaware, New Jersey,
appeared as pianist at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia,
at the age of four! His musical training abroad included
several years with Paderewski. He has made many
concert tours in Europe and America, and for two seasons
has conducted the children’s concerts of the New York
Philharmonic Society. His important orchestral works
include a symphonic legend, a suite, two numbers, <cite><span lang="la">Suite
Phantastique</span></cite> and <cite>Impressions From An Artist’s Life</cite>, for
piano and orchestra, and his latest work to enjoy wide
popularity, <cite>The Victory Ball</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>John Powell—Virginian</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>All the charm and refinement of the Southern gentleman
are reflected in John Powell’s personality, along with
an earnest sincerity and conviction. He was born in Richmond,
Virginia, (1882), is a graduate of the University of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>Virginia, and a pupil of Theodor Leschetizky and Navratil
in Vienna. He has made an international reputation as
brilliant pianist and is also one of our most gifted composers.
Powell’s works show classical training in form,
with which he combines a rich romantic feeling and a love
for folk music.</p>

<p class='c008'>He believes that music should draw on the folk element
for its strength, and has proved his theory by using freely
the folk music he knows best, that of the negro. <cite>In the
South</cite>, <cite>At the Fair</cite>, piano pieces, show this early influence
and his fund of humor, and in his <cite>Negro Rhapsody</cite> for piano
and orchestra, Powell has painted a picture of the negro in
many moods—sinister and menacing, primitive bordering
on barbaric, as well as humorous, care-free and childlike.</p>

<p class='c008'>His <cite><span lang="it">Sonata Teutonica</span></cite> which first brought him before the
public is of extraordinary strength, length and talent.
He has written other sonatas for piano and for violin, songs,
chamber music and orchestral works.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Negro Spirituals versus Jazz</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>This brings us face to face with one of the most discussed
questions of the day: the influence of Negro music and jazz
on serious composition. The pure Negro music is the
Spiritual and <em>not</em> jazz, which may be the typically American
idiom we have been waiting for.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not Negro but is developed from the Negro dance
rhythm, from a real folk music; it is the result of Negro
music played upon by American life and influences; through
it we may learn to free ourselves musically, and show the
true American spirit of adventure and daring which until
now has been absent in our native compositions. The
path has been travelled from the songs of Stephen Foster,
Negro Minstrels, “coon songs” and “cake walks,” to jazz
with its elaborate orchestration unlike any other existing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>music, and its complicated rhythms. Jazz rhythm is contrapuntal
rhythm. Europe says that it is our one original
and important contribution to music! This is a strong
statement, but as “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,”
their serious 20th century composers have flattered
us by writing jazz, and we have <cite>Piano Rag</cite> by Stravinsky,
a <cite>Syncopated Sonata</cite> by Jean Wiener, jazz by Darius Milhaud,
Casella, Honegger, and even Debussy was tempted
into writing <cite>Golliwogg’s Cake Walk</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Los Angeles (April, 1925), Walter Henry Rothwell
with his Philharmonic Orchestra played an <cite>American
Caprice</cite> by Henry Schoenefeld (1857) one of many works in
which the composer has used Indian and Negro themes.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Henry Thacker Burleigh, Most Noted Colored Composer</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>His arrangement of the Spiritual, <cite>Deep River</cite>, has made
Harry Burleigh’s name known on two continents, and its
success has led many into that field. Burleigh (1866) was
one of the foremost among the Dvorak pupils, and has
held the position of leading baritone in St. George’s Church
for many years, as also at the Temple Emanuel on Fifth
Avenue. His name is found on practically every program
where Spirituals are sung.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of Burleigh’s race is R. Nathaniel Dett (1882), conductor
of the Hampton Singers, also director of the music department
of Hampton College. His name was introduced
by Percy Grainger, who played his characteristic Negro
dance called <cite>Juba Dance</cite> in Europe and America. Dett’s
greatest works are his arrangements of the Spirituals for
chorus. Grainger wrote of him: “There is in his treatment
of blended human voices that innate sonority and
vocal naturalness that seem to result only from accumulated
long experience of untrained improvised polyphonic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>singing, such as that of Southern Negroes, South Sea Polynesians
and Russian peasants. These things are branches
of the very tree of natural communal song.”</p>

<p class='c008'>David Guion, a young Texan, is well known in this field
and also for his piano setting of <cite>Turkey in the Straw</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Louis Gruenberg Finds New Paths</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Louis Gruenberg (1884) was born in Russia but came to
America at the age of two. At nineteen he went to Europe
and became the pupil of Ferruccio Busoni, the Italian pianist-composer
who spent most of his life in Berlin and
Vienna and also taught for two years at the New England
Conservatory of Music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gruenberg had followed conventional lines of composition
for some years, receiving prizes in Berlin and New
York (in 1922 he was awarded the Flagler prize for a symphonic
poem <cite>Hill of Dreams</cite>). His works of this period
comprise symphonic poems, a string quartet, a piano concerto,
a symphony, a suite for violin, also a sonata, two operas,
songs and piano pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>He began to study America, to ask himself what was
the spirit of Americanism that had not yet found its way
into music, and his answer was not the Negro jazz, but
the white man’s jazz expressing the “spirit of the times.”
As a result he changed his way of writing. The compositions
of this period are a violin sonata, a set of piano pieces
called <cite>Polychromatics</cite>, a <cite>Poem</cite> in sonatina form for ’cello,
four pieces for string quartet, a viola sonata, an orchestral
tone-poem, a group of short piano pieces in jazz rhythms
with the amusing name of <cite>Jazzberries</cite>, three violin pieces in
the same style, a group of songs <cite>Animals and Insects</cite>, texts
by Vachel Lindsay, and that same poet’s <cite>Daniel</cite> which
Gruenberg has set as <cite>Daniel Jazz</cite> for tenor and chamber
music orchestra, and <cite>Creation</cite>, a Negro sermon by James
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>Weldon Johnson, a poet, who has just won the Spingarn
Prize for the most distinctive work (1924–1925) of an
American of African descent.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Two Jazz Geniuses</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Irving Berlin, the genius of the age in writing typical
American jazz, was born in Russia and has had no musical
training. He picks out his irresistible melodies by ear and
his aide writes them down to the delight of the millions in
all corners of the earth, from New York to the Sahara
desert, where the phonograph has carried them. The
sheiks no longer sing in ancient pentatonic melody to their
lady loves, but turn on the phonograph which ably plays
some of his hundred American songs: <cite>My Wife Goes to
the Country</cite>, <cite>Snooky Ookums</cite>, <cite>Along Came Ruth</cite>, <cite>If You
Don’t Want Me Why Do You Hang Around?</cite> <cite>Mandy</cite>, <cite>Say
it with Music</cite>, <cite>What’ll I Do</cite>, <cite>All Alone</cite>, and many from the
musical revues (Music Box Revue, especially). His earlier
<cite>Alexander’s Rag Time Band</cite> goes back to cake walk days
and has become a classic of its kind and the model for
popular music following it. He rose from poverty to riches
through giving great delight to the public.</p>

<p class='c008'>George Gershwin (1898) flashed into the lime-light
through his jazz piano concerto <cite>Rhapsody in Blue</cite> and his
extraordinary playing of it with Paul Whiteman’s Orchestra.
In this piece we find a merging of classic form with
the “voice of the people”! It will be interesting to watch
this young man, not yet thirty, to see the outcome of grafting
a musical education on to his unusual natural gifts.
As a result of the success of his experiment he has been
commissioned to write a <cite>New York Concerto</cite> for the New
York Symphony. He is a Brooklyn boy brought up as a
“song plugger” for a publisher of popular music, playing
their songs in vaudeville acts and in cafés.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Charles Tomlinson Griffes</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Charles Tomlinson Griffes (1884–1920) was a poet-composer
whose early death was a serious loss to America, for
every thing he wrote was an addition to our music. He
was impressionistic in style, and we are grateful for the
lovely art songs, <cite>Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan</cite>,
three songs with orchestral accompaniment to poems of
Fiona MacLeod, ten piano pieces and the Sonata which
have never been surpassed in beauty and workmanship by
any American, the <cite>Poem</cite> for flute and orchestra, the string
quartet on Indian themes, and his orchestral tone-poem,
<cite>The Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan</cite>. For the stage, Griffes
composed a Japanese mime-play, <cite>Schojo</cite>, a dance drama,
<cite>The Kairn of Korwidwen</cite> and Walt Whitman’s <cite><span lang="fr">Salut au
Monde</span></cite>, a dramatic ballet. The last two were presented at
the Neighborhood Playhouse, where interesting experiments
in music and the drama have been made by the
Misses Lewisohn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Griffes was a native of Elmira, New York, and his first
studies were made with Miss Mary S. Broughton, who
recognized her young pupil’s unusual talent and took him
to Germany for study. His composition work was done
with Humperdinck, and Rüfer, and from 1907 until his
death he taught music at Hackley, a boys’ school in Tarrytown,
New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lawrence Gilman, American critic, says of him: “He
was a poet with a sense of comedy.... Griffes had never
learned how to pose—he would never have learned how if
he had lived to be as triumphantly old and famous as
Monsieur Saint-Saëns or Herr Bruch or Signor Verdi....
It was only a short while before his death that the Boston
Symphony Orchestra played for the first time (in Boston)
his <cite>Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan</cite>&#160;... and the general
concert-going public turned aside&#160;... to bestow an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>approving hand upon this producer of a sensitive and imaginative
tone-poetry who was by some mysterious accident,
an American!... He was a fastidious craftsman,
a scrupulous artist. He was neither smug nor pretentious
nor accommodating. He went his own way,—modestly,
quietly, unswervingly&#160;... having the vision of the
few....”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Whithorne’s American Impressions</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Emerson Whithorne (1884) was born in Cleveland, Ohio,
and studied there and in Europe. After writing some forty
songs and compositions in Oriental and European fashion,
he has given us in his <cite>New York Days and Nights</cite>, a group
of piano pieces in which are cleverly pictured Times Square,
Hudson River ferry boats, Trinity Church chimes, etc.
His latest work is a ballet, <cite>Sooner and Later</cite>, written with
Miss Irene Lewisohn for the Neighborhood Playhouse,
in which they have combined the primitive and the very
modern in an original and pictureful manner.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Albert Spalding—America’s Violinist-Composer</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When Walter Damrosch took the New York Symphony
Orchestra on tour in Europe, Albert Spalding (1888, Chicago)
went along as joint soloist with John Powell, playing
his violin concerto. Besides this, Spalding has written
many small pieces for violin, other orchestral and piano
works, and a string quartet played (1924) by the Flonzaley
Quartet. Spalding ranks with the great violinists of the
world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three other violinists showing talent as composers are
Edwin Grasse (1884), who in spite of the handicap of
blindness, has composed some charming violin pieces, violin
sonatas and string quartets; Samuel Gardner, who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>written orchestral works, chamber music and short violin
pieces; and Cecil Burleigh, short poetic pieces for violin
and for piano and a violin concerto.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>American Music Guild</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>To encourage the composing and appreciation of high
class American composition, ten American composers
formed an association, the <cite>American Music Guild</cite>. The
members are Marion Bauer, Chalmers Clifton, Louis
Gruenberg, Sandor Harmati, Charles Haubiel, Frederick
Jacobi, A. Walter Kramer, Harold Morris, Albert Stoessel
and Deems Taylor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Albert Stoessel (1894, St. Louis) is professor of music at
New York University, conductor of the New York Oratorio
Society, of the New York Symphony concerts at Chautauqua,
N. Y., of the Worcester Festival and composer of
chamber music and orchestral works.</p>

<p class='c008'>Deems Taylor (1885, New York) is musical critic of the
New York <cite>World</cite>, and the composer of songs and orchestral
works (<cite>Through the Looking Glass</cite> Suite) and he has
written much choral and incidental music for plays and
motion pictures. One of his most graceful works is the
ballet in <cite>The Beggar on Horseback</cite>. His opera <cite>The King’s
Henchman</cite> was given at the Metropolitan Opera House in
1927. The book is by Edna St. Vincent Millay.</p>

<p class='c008'>A. Walter Kramer (1890, New York) is a critic and writer
on musical subjects, composer of many songs that have
made his name familiar, orchestral works, a <cite>Rhapsody</cite> for
violin and orchestra, pieces for violin, organ and piano, and
a symphonic tone poem on Masefield’s <cite>Tragedy of Nan</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harold Morris (1889, Texas) has never written little
pieces, but has jumped into classical forms which he treats
in a most modern way, in piano sonatas, a violin sonata, a
trio, quartet, a concerto for piano and orchestra, and a
tone poem on a Tagore text. He has studied only in America.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>Frederick Jacobi (1891, San Francisco), had his latest
work, a symphony, performed in 1924; he has also written
a string quartet on Indian themes, songs with orchestra,
short pieces and orchestral tone poems in all of which his
gift of poetic expression is uppermost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chalmers Clifton (1889, Jackson, Miss.), is conductor of
an orchestra which has as object the training of young
orchestra players, a much needed addition to American
musical education. He has written some chamber music
and music for a pageant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandor Harmati (1894), Hungarian by birth, founded the
Lenox String Quartet and has composed several string
quartets and orchestral works. He has taken numerous
prizes for his compositions and is now conductor of the
Omaha Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charles Haubiel (1894, Delta, Ohio), has composed works
in the classical form and is teacher of piano and theory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion Bauer (1887) was born in Walla Walla, Washington.
She has written 30 songs, 20 piano pieces, two violin
sonatas, a string quartet, and a work for chamber music
orchestra, and choruses. She writes and lectures on music,
and is Asst. Professor at New York University.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>American Academy in Rome</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A few years ago Edward MacDowell was one of the
founders of an Academy in Rome for American students
on the principle of the Roman prize of the Paris Conservatory.
Several of the young prize-winners have profited by
their visit to the ancient city of culture where they are living
and working with funds provided by the Academy.
Unfortunately the music fellowship does not admit women!
Among those to enjoy this advantage are Leo Sowerby
(1895, Grand Rapids, Michigan) who has written a piano
concerto and a double piano concerto, also a work called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span><cite>Synconata</cite> in syncopated rhythms which has been played
by Paul Whiteman and many other compositions in large
and small forms; Howard Hanson (1896, Wahoo, Nebraska)
who is now director of the Eastman School of Music at
Rochester, New York, and has written a number of
orchestral and chamber music works; and Wintter Watts,
the composer of many beautiful art songs and an orchestral
tone poem, <cite>Young Blood</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Leo Ornstein—The Independent</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>“What are discords?” was asked of Leo Ornstein (1895,
Russia). “I can not tell,” he answered. “Somewhere
there is a law of harmony.... What it is I can not tell.
Only I know that under certain conditions&#160;... I hear
it, I get color impressions.... If some of the tones are
gray, somber, violent is that my fault?... In a word,
I am not concerned with form or with standards of any
nature.” This is the young composer’s declaration of independence,
and in his early compositions he has lived up to
it! One of his piano works, <cite>Wildmen’s Dance</cite>, goes back
to primitive man for his inspiration and wild rhythms.
He is original and daring as few Americans have ever
been. His last work was a piano concerto played by him
with the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. He has written
sonatas for piano, for ’cello and violin, besides many
piano pieces, which he plays well, as he is an exceptional
pianist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although he has been in America since childhood, his
early life in Russia, in which he suffered the terrors of the
pogroms (the massacres of the Jews), is reflected in his
work. His training was under the direction of Bertha Tapper
and Percy Goetschius.</p>

<p class='c008'>A gifted young modernist whose orchestral and chamber
works are often played by important organizations, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>Aaron Copland (1898), pupil of Rubin Goldmark and
Nadia Boulanger, of Paris. He received (1925) the first
Guggenheim Fellowship in Music.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Experimentalists</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Henry Eichheim, of Boston, has had many performances
of his colorful Chinese and Japanese impressions. Carl
Ruggles is an independent thinker and composer, experimenting
in many combinations of harmonies and instruments.
Two extremists, who have not yet proven the
value of their ideas and whose works must be regarded as
experiments are Henry Cowell of California and George
Antheil who lives in Paris. Sometimes, however, out of
the wildest experiment comes something that may make
music grow.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Song Writers</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>There are many composers who are well known not for
symphonies and chamber music but for songs. There are
so many that we can list but a few: Alexander Russell,
R. Huntington Woodman, Carl Deis, William Arms
Fischer, Charles Fonteyn Manney, Clayton Johns, Sidney
Homer, Charles Gilbert Spross, Oley Speaks, Louis Campbell-Tipton,
Philip James, William C. Hammond, G. Bainbridge
Crist, Marshall Kernochan, Eastwood Lane, Richard
Hammond, Harry Osgood, Charles B. Hawley, Adolph
Martin Foerster, Richard Hageman, Edward Ballantine,
Clough Leighter, Victor Harris, Isidore Luckstone, Percy
Lee Atherton, John Beach, Paolo Gallico, Arthur Bergh,
Morris Class, Walter Morse Rummel, Blair Fairchild,
Rudolph Ganz (Swiss-American), Eugen Haile (German-American),
Frank La Forge, Harold Vincent Milligan,
Timothy Spelman, Edward Horsman, Tom Dobson, Oscar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>G. Sonneck. Mr. Sonneck (1873–1928) was less known as
a musicianly composer, than as a musicologist whose vast
knowledge made him invaluable as the first librarian of the
music division of the Library of Congress in Washington
(1902–1915). His books form an important addition to
musical <cite>Americana</cite>. He was editor of the <cite><span lang="it">Musical Quarterly</span></cite>,
and secretary of the Beethoven Association.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Foreigners Writing in America</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Many who are making music grow in America were born
in Europe and while they may not be <em>American</em> composers,
they are composers in America, and most of them have
become American citizens.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ernest Bloch, born in Geneva, Switzerland (1880), has
been here since 1916, when the Flonzaley Quartet played
his <cite>String Quartet</cite>. Owing to his Jewish descent his work
shows an Oriental strain rather than Swiss national feeling.
Among his important orchestral works are <cite>Jewish
Poems</cite>, <cite>Psalms</cite>, a symphony, <cite>Israel</cite>, <cite><span lang="es">Schelomo</span></cite>, for ’cello
and orchestra, a prize symphonic rhapsody, <cite>America</cite>,
and a <cite>Concerto Grosso</cite> for strings. He took the Coolidge
prize with his <cite>Viola Suite</cite>, and has also a violin
sonata and a piano quintet. He has taught in New
York, Cleveland and San Francisco. A pupil, Ethel
Leginska, the English pianist and orchestral conductor,
has composed an interesting string quartet, piano pieces
and works for orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Percy Aldridge Grainger, born in Melbourne, Australia
(1882), appeared as a pianist at the age of ten and has never
stopped since! His mother was his first teacher and later
he was a pupil of Busoni and intimate friend of Grieg,
whose concerto he played upon his first American appearance
(1915). During the World War he became naturalized
and served in the American army. As composer he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>is unique, being self-taught, and although knowing the
compositions of all the great masters, he goes to folk music
for his themes and ideas, and has become an authority
on British and Scandinavian folk music, and is collecting
music of the American Indian and the Negro.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among Grainger’s best known pieces are: <cite>Molly on the
Shore</cite>, <cite>Colonial Song</cite>, <cite>Shepherd’s Hey</cite>, <cite>Irish Tune from
County Derry</cite>, <cite>Country Gardens</cite> and <cite>Turkey in the Straw</cite>,
all folk-melodies around which he has woven most fascinating
harmonies, and has brought back the old songs in
modern dress. In the spring of 1925 he gave two concerts
which he called, with true Grainger originality, “Room
Music” instead of chamber music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carl Engel, although born in Paris (1883), and educated
in France is an American citizen and the director of
the Music Division of the Library of Congress in Washington,
D. C. Engel has written in addition to essays in delightful
style, a <cite>Tryptich</cite> (a violin sonata in three movements), and
enchanting songs, marking him a lover of modern harmony.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two Frenchmen in New York, Carlos Salzedo, one of the
world’s leading harpists, and Edgar Varese are foremost
among the innovators, bringing to the public through their
own compositions and the work of the <em>International Composers’
Guild</em>, the latest styles in music. They hand the
public the new works of the most extreme composers before
the ink is dry on the manuscript. Most of these are composed
in dissonance or so-called cacophony (from two Greek
words kakos,—bad; phono,—sounds). Through the efforts
of these men, the <em>League of Composers</em>, and the <em>Pro Musica</em>
Society (E. Robert Schmitz, founder and president), many
present day compositions are heard in America.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lazare Saminsky, a Russian, choirmaster at Temple
Emanu-El, New York, has written several symphonies and
a chamber opera, <cite>Gagliarda of a Merry Plague</cite>. He has
made a deep study of Hebrew music.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>Kurt Schindler, (Berlin, 1882), first conductor of the
New York Schola Cantorum, a chorus, is an authority on
Russian, Spanish and Finnish folk music, of which he has
made many collections. He has also written art songs
and choruses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leopold Godowsky, born in Russia (1870), one of the
greatest living pianists, has written much for piano and
made many arrangements.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the world famous violinists, several living in
America, Fritz Kreisler (1875), Mischa Elman (1892) and
Efrem Zimbalist (1889), have added to violin literature,
arrangements of piano pieces and songs, as well as a few
original compositions. Kreisler, with Victor Jacobi, wrote
the music for the light opera <cite>Apple Blossoms</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Some Patrons of Music in America</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>America has been fortunate in its patrons of music who
like the Esterhazys and Lobkowitzs of old have advanced
music by founding and maintaining orchestras, music
schools, chamber music, festivals and prize competitions.
Among these are Henry Lee Higginson (1834–1919), Boston
Symphony; Harry Harkness Flagler, New York Symphony;
W. A. Clark, Los Angeles Philharmonic; George Eastman,
Rochester Symphony and Eastman School of Music;
Juilliard Musical Foundation, Mrs. Edward Bok, Curtis
Institute of Music in Philadelphia; the Edward J. de
Coppet (1855–1916), the Flonzaley Quartet; Carl Stoeckel,
festivals at Norfolk, Connecticut; Mr. and Mrs. Daniel
Guggenheim and Mr. and Mrs. Murry Guggenheim, summer
concerts by Edwin Franko Goldman’s Concert Band;
Mrs. Elizabeth Shurtleff Coolidge, Berkshire Chamber
Music Festivals. Also the American Society for the Publication
of Chamber Music, the National Music League, the
Walter Naumberg prize, the National Federation of Music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>Clubs, the League of Composers, the National Bureau for
the advancement of Music, and many music schools and
settlements have helped to make music grow.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not out of place to include here Arthur P. Schmidt
(1846–1921) of Boston as a patron of music, for by his
devotion to American composers and the faith with which
he published their works as early as 1876 has made music
grow. Under this head we must also include Gustav
Schirmer (1829–1893) and Oliver Ditson (1811–1888).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Symphony Orchestras</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Besides the orchestras in Boston, New York and Chicago,
of which we have already told you, many new ones have
been formed to the advancement of music in America:
Philadelphia, (Leopold Stokowski, conductor); Detroit,
(Ossip Gabrilowitsch); San Francisco, (Alfred Hertz);
Cincinnati, (Fritz Reiner); Los Angeles, (Arthur Rodzinsky);
St. Louis, (Guest Conductors); Cleveland, (Nikolai
Sokoloff and Rudolph Ringwall); Rochester, (Eugene
Goossens); Syracuse, (Vladimir Shavitch); Omaha, (Sandor
Harmati); Portland, Oregon, (Willem van Hoogstraten);
Minneapolis, (Henri Verbrugghen); State Symphony
Orchestra, New York City, founded by Josef Stransky,
(Emo von Dohnanyi and Alfredo Casella, in the season
of 1925–26); and the American Symphony Orchestra
composed entirely of Americans under Howard Barlow,
founder and conductor; the Young Men’s Symphony
Orchestra (Paul Henneberg), founded by the late Alfred
Lincoln Seligman with Arnold Volpe, conductor; American
Orchestral Society, (Chalmers Clifton). (See page <a href='#Page_514'>514</a>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the orchestras mentioned, the symphony orchestras
of the motion picture houses all over the country are
doing a very great service by the excellent music and the
fine performances given to millions of people every day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>Among orchestras which helped to build love of music
in this country were the Russian Symphony Orchestra
(Modest Altschuler), the Volpe Symphony Orchestra
(Arnold Volpe), and the People’s Symphony Concerts
(F. X. Arens), all of which are out of existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the last few years the desire for music in the
summer time has led to many open air concerts and operas.
Of these the concerts of the Philharmonic Orchestra in the
Lewisohn Stadium, those in the Hollywood Bowl (Los
Angeles, California), Willow Grove, Pa., the Goldman
Concert Band, playing on the Campus of New York
University and in Central Park are the most widely
known.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ravinia Park which provides one of the most magnificent
opera companies possible to assemble makes a delightful
summer night playground for Chicago people.</p>

<p class='c008'>We regret that opera has not kept pace with the symphony
orchestras in America. The Metropolitan Opera
Company (New York City), the Chicago Opera Company
(Chicago, Illinois), the San Francisco Opera Company
(G. Merola’s new venture), the Philadelphia Civic and
the American Opera Company are in operation (1929).
There are many cities holding summer opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is every reason to be proud of the growth of music
in America, and New York City today is the great musical
center of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since writing this chapter, New York has lost the
State Symphony, The American Symphony Orchestra,
and the New York Symphony Society. Walter
Damrosch has turned his orchestral interests
to the radio in order to enlarge the sphere of music
education. Due to the merger of the Philharmonic Symphony,
Ernest Schelling conducts the concerts
for children.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXII<br> <span class='c016'>Twentieth Century Music</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There was once an old man who said: “I have lived
to see the post-chaise give way to the locomotive
but I <em>cannot</em> and <em>will not</em> accept the automobile!” What
would he have said to the aeroplane? But this old man
was not different from the people today, who seem unable
to accept the new music and take it as a personal affront
when they must listen to it. Like the automobile and the
aeroplane, however, it is here, and is a part of the 20th
century!</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing that lives stands still; there must be constant
change and growth, or decay sets in. This is as true of
music as it is of ourselves and the things around us. We
have watched this process of change in music from prehistoric
man to the 20th century; we have seen certain
periods bursting with new ideas, works and forms; we
have seen individuals tower above their fellows, marking
epochs to which their names have become attached, like
the Palestrinian era, the Bach era, and the Wagner period;
and we are living in a moment of new ideas, works and
forms, on which we cannot pass final judgment. Time
alone must be the judge!</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no point at which a period ends and a new
one begins, for they overlap. We saw harmony grow out
of polyphony; we saw the romantic Beethoven rise out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>the classic Beethoven; in the romantic Chopin, we found
the germs of impressionism (for definition, see page <a href='#Page_483'>483</a>),
and in Debussy’s impressionism, we see the breaking away
from traditions into a new world of sound.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Polyform Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When we begin our music lessons, we are taught the musical
alphabet,—the major scale, and then, the minor and
the chromatic. So accustomed are we to these scales
that we forget there was a time when they did not exist,
and that new ones may be added, for they are not fixed
for all time. There have been, as you know, the no-scale
time, the pentatonic scale, the Greek modes, the Ecclesiastical
or Church modes, the diatonic (major and minor)
scale, the chromatic scale and the so-called whole-tone
scale of Debussy. Beethoven and all the writers of the
classic period used the diatonic scales which gave their
works a definite tonality, that is, a home tone to which
all the tones try to return. If, for example, you sing <cite>Yankee
Doodle</cite> and stop before the last note, you feel very uncomfortable,
because you have not sounded the home tone
towards which all the tones are reaching. To the diatonic
modes, Chopin and Wagner added a frequent use of the
chromatic scale, which enriched music. In addition to diatonic
and chromatic harmony, along came Debussy with
his melodies in whole steps, and he also went back to the
old Greek modes, using them in new and unexpected ways.
Today we have all the past to draw upon and the composers
are quick to take advantage of their rich inheritance
and to add innovations.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the 20th century the influences have come from Paris
and Vienna,—Debussy and Schoenberg,—and later Stravinsky,
the Russian. From the French has come a style of
writing called <em>polytonality</em>, and from Vienna has come
<em>atonality</em>. Don’t be afraid of these names for they are
easily explained!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>Having said that <em>tonality</em> is a system in which all tones
gravitate to a central tone (they all come home to roost!)
it is not difficult to understand through the formation of
the word <em>poly</em>—many, <em>tonal</em>—tones, that it means the use
of several keys or tonalities at the same time, a counterpoint
of key against key, or scale against scale, instead of
note against note as it was in the Golden Age of Polyphony.
Think of a <i><span lang="la">cantus firmus</span></i> in C major, and a counter melody
in F♯ minor! (Between ourselves if <em>skilfully handled</em>, it
has possibilities!) Ravel, Milhaud and Honegger know
how to do it. Of course in the old system we change from
key to key by means of a musical bridge called <em>modulation</em>,
but in polytonality, the bridge is discarded, and the unrelated
keys are heard piled on top of each other in layers.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Atonality</em>, the system which Schoenberg and his followers
use, is based on the chromatic scale of twelve half steps, on
each one of which, chords (major and minor) may be built.
This gives a more varied tonal paint-box than the old diatonic
modes and the chromatic scale of former days, for
it has now become an independent scale, and is not a part
of the diatonic family.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Multi-and Poly-Rhythms</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Rhythm also reflects this age of unrest, and there have
been decided changes which seem to return to the Middle
Ages to the period of bar-less music writing. Instead of
finding a piece written throughout in ¾ metre or ⁴⁄₄, it will
be <em>multi-rhythmic</em> or <em>poly-rhythmic</em>. <cite>Multi-rhythmic</cite> means
many shiftings from one rhythm to another; <em>poly-rhythmic</em>
means a counterpoint of different rhythms all played at
the same time. The English composer, Cyril Scott, uses
multi-rhythms (where almost every measure changes its
metre), and the French Florent Schmitt uses poly-rhythms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>(for example, triplets against eighth notes in common time
in the right hand, and ⁶⁄₈ metre in the left).</p>

<p class='c008'>In the 15th and 16th centuries every one wrote motets,
masses and madrigals; in the 17th century every one
wrote suites and from this time on, opera; in the 18th, sonata
form; in the 19th, sonatas and short romantic pieces.
In the 20th century, no one form is used more than another,
but all forms are undergoing changes as the composers
reach out for freedom. This is the day of the large
orchestra and of the small chamber music groups; symphonies
have been replaced by the shorter symphonic
poem, the tendency being for short forms. The four-hour
music drama has given way to the one-act operas,
and the dance drama or ballet as the Russian Diaghilev
introduced it, is a 20th century development. The orchestral
writing has changed greatly from the methods of Berlioz,
Wagner and Strauss, for while they were masters of
large mass effects, the composers of today are treating each
instrument individually, in other words, they are using
orchestration, <em>poly-instrumentally</em>! In chamber music, we
have the string quartet, but in addition, many experiments
are being made in combining instruments of unrelated
families, like strings, wind, brass and percussion, as we find
in Stravinsky’s chamber music.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is often said that modern music has no melody, but
it would be more correct to say that it has <em>new</em> melody,
resulting from the attempt to push aside old forms, old
harmonies, old rhythms; now we have arrived at a new
era of polyphony, abounding in dissonance, that often is
cacophonous rather than harmonious. We call this period
the <span class='sc'>Polyformic</span> era.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Another Renaissance</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The men who ushered in this <span class='sc'>Polyformic</span> era were
Claude Debussy in Paris, Arnold Schoenberg in Vienna,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>and Alexander Scriabin in Russia. Richard Strauss, then
at his height, is a good example of the overlapping of two
periods, for he represents the classical German school of
the 19th century, and has also pointed the way to the
future. Igor Stravinsky, although younger, is one of the
strongest factors in this new Renaissance which in scope
and power reminds us of the rebirth of learning in the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another cause for the breaking away from old forms and
conditions was the World War, which cut off the composers
from the usual sources of musical supply, and forced
them to develop their own ideas. This led to new groups
arising in all parts of the world, who, rebelling against
restraint, put wild experiments in the place of time honored
customs.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Claude Achille Debussy</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Although Claude Achille Debussy (1862–1918) was
almost forty when the 20th century came in, only in this
century has his work been known and imitated. He was
the direct outcome of a movement in France, after the
Franco-Prussian War to develop French music along the
lines started by Rameau and Couperin. This meant
breaking away from the classic models of Beethoven and
the dramatic music of Wagner. He exchanged the romantic
style of Schumann and Chopin for a new impressionistic
style.</p>

<p class='c008'>Claude Debussy was born in St. Germain-en-Laye, near
Paris. He attended the Paris Conservatory when he was
eleven and studied with Marmontel, Lavignac and Guiraud.
In 1884, with a cantata, <cite><span lang="fr">L’Enfant Prodigue</span></cite>, he won
the <i><span lang="fr">Prix de Rome</span></i> which has started the career of so many
French composers! During this, his first period, he wrote
many lovely songs to poems by Verlaine and Baudelaire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>the same impressionistic poets who inspired Charles Martin
Loeffler in America; <cite>Suite Bergamasque</cite>, which includes
the lovely <cite><span lang="fr">Clair de Lune</span></cite> (<cite>Moonlight</cite>); the work which
first brought him fame, <cite><span lang="fr">L’Après-midi d’un Faune</span></cite> (<cite>Afternoon
of a Faun</cite>); the beautiful string quartet; <cite><span lang="fr">Chansons
de Bilitis</span></cite>; <cite>Three Nocturnes for Orchestra</cite>, and the unique
opera <cite>Pelleas and Melisande</cite>, which took him ten years to
write! It was first given in the Paris <cite><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></cite> (1902).</p>

<p class='c008'>In this opera, Debussy showed himself an innovator; it
was a new kind of harmony and melody and never before
had an opera like it been written. He gave an exact impression
in music of Maeterlinck’s imaginative, mystic
play. This is not a case where music drowns the meaning
of the story but each word is colored and interpreted by the
music. Debussy accomplished what the Camerata, Gluck
and Wagner tried to do. By the time he wrote <cite>Pelleas
and Melisande</cite>, his style was established and the proof of his
high attainment is seen in his many imitators.</p>

<p class='c008'>He worked very slowly and carefully and often destroyed
what had taken him hours to write. Although an innovator,
he was a deep student well grounded in the traditions
of the past, a lover of Mozart and of the 18th century
French writers, and when he seemingly broke all rules he
gave something new in their place, not in the spirit of
experiment but of sincere conviction.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was surrounded by painters who like Claude Monet,
Pissarro and Sisley did not paint <em>actual things</em>, but rather
ideals of things; and by poets who like Verlaine, Gustave
Kahn, Henri de Régnier, Pierre Louys and Stéphane
Mallarmé did not write about <em>things</em> but rather the <em>impression</em>
and <em>images</em> things gave them. He was absorbed and
delighted by this non-photographic kind of art and translated
into his music the veiled, mystic, idealistic, silver
glimmering impressions that others put into paint and
into words. This is <em>Impressionism</em> in art.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>Musically, Debussy was influenced by Wagner, although
he fought against him, and by some of the French composers
in whose day he began to write, like Chabrier and
Chausson. From Moussorgsky and other Russians he
learned much about old modes, color effects and free
expression; and with Erik Satie he talked over many musical
problems, no doubt gaining much from this curious
musical caricaturist and humorist. No matter how extreme
and absurd Debussy’s music might have sounded
twenty-five years ago to the people, they must have felt
the mystic beauty and rare poetic charm of his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Someone, as a joke, put a Butterick pattern on a playerpiano
roll as a music record, and it sounded so ridiculous
that a composer hearing it, said: “Ah, that must be a
Debussy piece!” But, you see this was twenty-five years
ago!</p>

<p class='c008'>No matter how revolutionary his piano pieces may have
sounded, today they have become almost classics! The
combination of poetic imagination, romanticism and impressionism
are seen in the titles: <cite><span lang="fr">Reflets dans l’eau</span></cite> (<cite>Reflections
in the Water</cite>), <cite><span lang="fr">L’Isle joyeuse</span></cite> (<cite>Happy Island</cite>), <cite><span lang="fr">La
Cathédrale engloutie</span></cite> (<cite>The Engulfed Cathedral</cite>), <cite><span lang="fr">Jardins sous
la pluie</span></cite> (<cite>Gardens in the Rain</cite>).</p>

<p class='c008'>For his daughter Claude, who died the year after her
father, Debussy wrote six little piano pieces called the
<cite>Children’s Corner</cite>. At the time he was writing them, little
Claude used to drag the manuscripts around like a ragdoll,
telling anyone she met, “These are <em>my</em> pieces, my
father is writing them for me.” They were: <cite><span lang="la">Dr. Gradus ad
Parnassum</span></cite>, <cite>Jimbo’s Lullaby</cite>, <cite>The Doll’s Serenade</cite>, <cite>The
Snow Falls</cite>, <cite>The Little Shepherd</cite> and <cite>Golliwogg’s Cakewalk</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among his later works are: Three symphonic sketches,
<cite><span lang="fr">La Mer</span></cite> (<cite>The Sea</cite>); the mystery play on a book by d’Annunzio,
<cite><span lang="fr">Le Martyre de St. Sebastien</span></cite> (<cite>The Martyrdom of St.
Sebastian</cite>); a work for two pianos, <cite><span lang="fr">Noir et Blanc</span></cite> (<cite>Black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>and White</cite>); a <cite>Sonata for Violoncello and Piano</cite> and twelve
<cite>Studies for Piano</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his <cite>Minstrels</cite>, <cite>Children’s Corner</cite> and <cite>General Lavine</cite>
we find <em>humor</em>, a characteristic of 20th century music.</p>

<p class='c008'>His music was vague and dreamy, and many composers
were weakened rather than strengthened by trying to imitate
him, for they had neither his genius nor his poetry.
What he gave us was genuine, what others tried to copy
was affected. His inventions such as the whole-tone scale
and the pastel shades of music were so much a part of
him that to use them today shows a lack of originality.
But to those coming after him, who did not imitate him
but worked out their own ways, he was a path-breaker of
great value.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Maurice Ravel</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Maurice Ravel (1875) has lived in or near Paris most of
his life, although he was born in Ciboure, Basses-Pyrénées.
He was a student at the Conservatory under Gabriel Fauré
and André Gédalge. He did not receive the <i><span lang="fr">Prix de Rome</span></i>,
perhaps because in his early works he already showed
tendencies, which must have seemed revolutionary to musicians
who had not yet grown accustomed to the innovations
of Debussy. Ravel developed his ideas at the same
time and under the same influences as Debussy. You
will often hear that Ravel imitated Debussy, but it is less
an imitation than a development along the same lines.
Ravel, too, is an impressionist, a poet, a lover of veiled
mystic effects, <em>suggesting</em> images rather than <em>reproducing</em>
them. He has a keen rhythmic sense, perhaps a heritage
of his birthplace, so close to the Spanish border.</p>

<p class='c008'>None of the 20th century composers understands the
orchestra better than Ravel as may be seen in his ballet
<cite>Daphnis and Chloe</cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">Rhapsodie Espagnole</span></cite>, his delightful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span><cite>Mother Goose</cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">La Valse</span></cite>. His short opera, <cite><span lang="fr">L’heure espagnole</span></cite>
is full of charming music and splendid workmanship;
his quartet written in 1902–3 is one of the finest examples
of 20th century chamber music. For piano he has added
a rich contribution in the <cite>Sonatina</cite>, <cite>Pavane for a Dead
Child</cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">Valses nobles et sentimentales</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">Les Miroirs</span></cite> (<cite>Looking
Glasses</cite>), <cite><span lang="fr">Gaspard de la Nuit</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">Le Tombeau de Couperin</span></cite>
(<cite>The Tomb of Couperin</cite>), and his songs are very beautiful,
including <cite><span lang="fr">Histoires Naturelles</span></cite> (<cite>Natural History</cite>) and the
Greek and Hebrew folk songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ravel’s latest work is a revelation of all his abilities,
<cite><span lang="fr">L’Enfant et les Sortilèges</span></cite> (<cite>The Child’s Sorceries</cite>), a ballet in
early form with modern music. It is a fantasy tale about
a little boy, who will not do his lessons and in a fury injures
a squirrel; the chairs, grandfather’s clock, frogs, fairies,
sprites, squirrels, arithmetic dwarfs from the book he has
destroyed, and tea-pots rebel and talk “at him,” until he
binds up the wound of the squirrel. Into this, Ravel puts
humor and even sentiment; he makes some of the chairs
dance a minuet, other characters, a fox trot, and includes
many old and new dances. He shows his magic handling
of the orchestra and with extreme cleverness he even has
the chair and the shepherdess sing a song in canon form and
at the end all join in singing a fugue of “heavenly beauty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A follower of Ravel is Maurice Delage, who has written
some very interesting songs and an orchestral work in
which he is modern enough to imitate the sounds of an
iron foundry!</p>

<p class='c008'>An enthusiastic follower and friend of Ravel, is Roland
Manuel, critic, writer and composer. He has never written
what is called <em>ultra</em> (very) modern music, but everything
he does, songs, chamber music, operetta, or ballet is marked
with good taste, refinement and fine musicianship.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other Frenchmen who have added to the 20th century
style are Paul Dukas (1865), whose opera based on Maeterlinck’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span><cite><span lang="fr">Ariane et Barbe Bleue</span></cite> (<cite>Ariadne and Blue Beard</cite>) is
second only to Debussy’s <cite><span lang="la">Pelleas et Melisande</span></cite>; Vincent
d’Indy (1851); Déodat de Sévérac (1873–1921), a writer
of charming piano music whose impressionism reflects his
love of Nature; Albert Roussel (1869), a pupil of the Schola
Cantorum, whose Symphony and opera <cite>Padmavati</cite> show
splendid talent; Florent Schmitt (1870) whose orchestral
works and piano quintet are important; André Caplet
(1880–1925), Charles Koechlin (1867), and Erik Satie
(1869–1925).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Erik Satie—Cartoonist</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Erik Satie is a riddle! Many are the heated discussions
he has caused. His influence has been through what he
has said, not what he has done. He was a caricaturist
rather than a great composer, giving amusing titles to
frivolous little pieces that show humor, in which one
never knows whether he was laughing <em>at</em> or <em>with</em> the world.
He loved short disconnected pieces and did much to make
the young composer break away from long symphonic
forms. He was a friend of Debussy, godfather to the
<cite>Group of Six</cite>, and later to four “youngsters” who call
themselves the “School of Arcueil” where Satie lived.
His name should have been Satyr for with his pointed
ears, eyebrows, and beard, he looked the part! Among his
compositions are the ballets, <cite>Parades</cite> and <cite>Relache</cite>, and a
dramatic aria with orchestra, <cite>Socrates</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The School of Arcueil, which has not yet proven its value
is composed of Sauguet, Maxime Jacob, Desormières and
Clicquet-Pleyel, who take pleasure in American jazz
effects and have tried amusing experiments.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Group of Six</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The World War reacted directly and indirectly upon a
group of composers in France. Daring and brutality are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>the keynote of almost all the works of the years from 1914
to the present day. Debussy and Ravel with their poetic
imagery did not express the feelings of the younger men, so
they were pitilessly brushed aside by <cite><span lang="fr">Les Jeunes</span></cite> (The
Young) who overthrew the accepted forms for their own
experiments.</p>

<p class='c008'>These young composers did not band together like the
“Russian Five,” but a French critic called them “The
Six,” and the name stuck! They were not united by oneness
of purpose or by ideal, they just happened to be friends
and their music was often presented on the same programs
and Erik Satie “who had been throughout thirty-five years
the instigator of all audacity, the manager of all impudence”
was their confidential adviser. The six are Germaine
Tailleferre who played her piano concerto in America
(1925) and has written two charming ballets; Louis
Durey (1888); Georges Auric (1899), and François Poulenc
(1899), both of whom have written ballets; Darius
Milhaud (1892) and Arthur Honegger (1892).</p>

<p class='c008'>Of these, Milhaud and Honegger are by far the most
important. Milhaud has written ballets, chamber music
and orchestral works with great fluency, often showing
fine gifts and flashes of beauty. Born into this age of
storm and stress, Milhaud has written brutally, but he
is at heart a romantic composer and will probably change
as we get further away from the war.</p>

<p class='c008'>Honegger has had a sensational success with a work in
oratorio form, <cite><span lang="fr">Le Roi David</span></cite> (<cite>King David</cite>), and with a tone
poem, <cite>Pacific—231</cite>, which is a type of locomotive. Honegger
has broken from the Group, and has gone his own
independent way, writing beautiful songs, orchestral and
chamber music, and giving promise of being one of the
most important composers of the period.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are many other young French composers showing
the different tendencies of the day, some are writing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>classic form, some in romantic, but all are very independent.
Some have wiped out the past and are trying to build
anew, not realizing that they are building on sand, for
there can be no skyscraper without a foundation deep
enough to carry it!</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Alexander Scriabin</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Alexander Nicolai Scriabin (1871–1915) was born in
Moscow, Russia, and was sent to a military school; instead
of becoming an army officer, he turned to music,
and was a pupil of Safonov, for several years conductor of
the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and of Taneiev.
His early works show the influence of Chopin and Arensky,
but he soon developed a style of his own, that has made
him one of the important composers of the beginning of
the 20th century. An English writer, Eaglefield Hull,
thinks that “the sonatas of Scriabin are destined in the
future to occupy a niche of their own, together with the
forty-eight Preludes of Bach, the thirty-two Sonatas of
Beethoven, and the piano works of Chopin.” To explain
in a few words the innovations of Scriabin would be impossible,
but he broke away from fixed scales and tonality, and
opened new roads to composers following. He used neither
polytonality nor atonality, although his methods border
on the latter. He built new chords, not major and minor
as we know them, but in intervals of fourths. Here is a
typical Scriabin chord which he used as we use a major
triad (c-e-g) as the center around which to build a composition:</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>[<a href="music/music526.mp3">Listen</a>] [<a href="music/music526.mxl">MusicXML</a>]</div>

<div id='i_526'  class='figcenter id005'>
<a href='images/music526.png'><img src='images/i_526.jpg' alt='Chord' class='ig001'></a>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Won’t you be surprised to hear that Scriabin went back
to Pythagoras and his theory of harmonics or overtones to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>get this chord? He called these combinations “mystic
chords” for he was a student of Theosophy, and wanted
to use music as a means to express occult ideas. With this
in mind, he wrote a tone-poem, <cite>Prometheus</cite>, which, according
to Scriabin’s directions, Modest Altschuler played in
New York with a color organ throwing colors on a screen
while the orchestra was playing the music. Two other
of his large works for orchestra <cite><span lang="fr">Le Divin Poème</span></cite> and
<cite><span lang="fr">Le Poème de L’Extase</span></cite> show his extraordinary harmonic
originality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the ten sonatas in very free form, he wrote hundreds
of shorter piano pieces, disclosing his deep poetic,
mystic nature. Composers have imitated him, but his
music is so tagged with Scriabin’s individuality that, like the
whole-tone scale of Debussy, imitation is easily detected.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'><span lang="fr">L’Enfant Terrible of Modern Music—Stravinsky</span></span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Igor Stravinsky (1882) has influenced more young musicians
than any other living composer! He intended to
become a lawyer, but instead studied composition with
Rimsky-Korsakov, and his early works reflect his teacher.
We never know how meeting someone may change our
course in life, and Stravinsky’s meeting with Serge Diaghilev
changed his!</p>

<p class='c008'>Diaghilev, director of the <cite>Russian Ballet</cite>, recognized a
gift in the young Stravinsky, who was busy writing an
opera from a fairy tale of Hans Christian Andersen, <cite>The
Nightingale</cite>. He commissioned him to write a ballet on a
fairy tale, <cite><span lang="fr">L’Oiseau de Feu</span></cite> (<cite>The Fire Bird</cite>) which was
produced in Paris (1910) and brought Stravinsky instant
fame. The next year this was followed by the delightful
<cite>Petrouchka</cite>. His most famous score <cite><span lang="fr">Le Sacre du Printemps</span></cite>
(<cite>Rites of Spring</cite>) was produced in Paris in 1913, causing a
near-riot, as it was received with hissing and catcalls by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>a public unprepared for its brutality, its savage rhythm,
and raucous dissonance.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this work Stravinsky went back to primitive times
when Russia was pagan, and he explains, “Thus we see
Russian peasants dancing in the springtime, accompanying
the rhythms by their gestures and their feet.” An
English critic Edwin Evans, sees behind the pagan rite,
“The marvelous power&#160;... in all Nature to grow, to
develop, and to assume new forms.” (We have watched
this happen in music.)</p>

<p class='c008'>After <cite><span lang="fr">Le Sacre du Printemps</span></cite>, Stravinsky wrote <cite><span lang="fr">Les Noces</span></cite>
a ballet founded on pagan Russian marriage customs. In
this work he has used a chorus of voices and four pianos
in place of an orchestra. He finished the opera <cite>The Nightingale</cite>
and in 1917 wrote an orchestral poem based on the
themes from the opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the short ballet <cite><span lang="fr">L’Histoire du Soldat</span></cite> (<cite>Story of the
Soldier</cite>), Stravinsky has used popular music of the fair,
circus, music hall, not folk music, and we find our jazz
and tango in it, as also in his <cite>Piano Rag Music</cite> and <cite>Ragtime</cite>
for orchestra. His songs composed for the most part to
nonsense verses, are among the cleverest things he has
done.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stravinsky wrote a group of string quartet pieces in
which he made the violins sound like bells. This was not
because he tried to imitate bells but on the strings he uses
the harmonics or overtones that are heard in bells. This
is one of the secrets of his unusual harmonies.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Overtones</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>We hear so much about overtones and harmonics that
perhaps we can trace for you the growth of music along
the path of Pythagoras’ theory, showing how we arrived
at this era of dissonance.</p>

<p class='c008'>First men and women singing in unison produced music
in octaves, 1 and 2 of the harmonic series. Next came the
centuries of <i><span lang="la">organum</span></i> when the parts were sung in fifths and
fourths, 2, 3, and 4 of the harmonic series. Then followed
the centuries of the major triad (c-e-g), 4, 5, and 6 of the
harmonic series. When the 7th overtone in the harmonic
series appeared, we had the very important dominant 7th
chord (c-e-g-b♭), looked upon as outrageous heresy and
dissonance! It was years, even centuries, before it was
admitted as a respectable member of the family! The 9th
harmonic forming the dominant 9th chord (c-e-g-b♭-d)
had the same hard row to hoe, and is one of our modern
chords. César Franck shocked the musicians by opening
his famous violin sonata with this chord! We can trace
the whole-tone scale of Debussy to the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th,
and 11th overtones of the series, (b♭-c-d-e-f#). Scriabin’s
“mystic chord” is formed from the 8th, 11th, 7th, 10th,
14th, and 9th overtones (c-f#–b♭-e-a-d). It is a short
step now to <em>polytonality</em> and <em>atonality</em>, to Stravinsky,
Schoenberg, Milhaud, and Honegger.</p>

<p class='c008'>You have seen the white ray of sunlight enter your window,
which upon a second glimpse divides into all the colors
of the rainbow. In other words, the white light is the
<em>fundamental tone</em>, which is the <em>sum</em> of <em>all the other colors</em>,
much as any <em>single tone</em> is the <em>sum</em> of <em>its overtones</em>, and it is
with these overtones that our modern composers are experimenting.
Here we see that modern music is the result of
<em>evolution</em> (slow growth) and not <em>revolution</em>!</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Heart Music Disappears</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Stravinsky, <i><span lang="fr">l’enfant terrible</span></i> in music, the most daring
composer of a most daring period has thrown over all
restraint! His music has no heart quality, and so strongly
is he influencing the younger men, that “heart music”
has gone out of style, a brusque, ugly music taking its place,
because the composers are afraid that to show sentiment
would be weakness! However, the high class music of
today is trying to express humor, activity and vigor, for
which reason our jazz appeals to Europeans. The War
made Stravinsky the “man of the hour” in music. He is
the direct opposite of the refined, beauty-worshipping
Debussy and mystic Scriabin. The composers upset by
the devastating war, needed strong food, and they hungrily
pounced upon the morsels flung to them by Stravinsky,
the ring-leader.</p>

<p class='c008'>But withal, “the worm will turn” and already, those with
ears to hear, realize a change in the air, and they foretell
a new classic period made out of this hurly-burly of
many forms, touched by the fairy wand, “Things-that-Live”!
And Stravinsky himself has turned.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Stravinsky had written several ballets for his
countryman, Diaghilev, he turned his attention to chamber
music, and wrote works for small groups of wind instruments
and a string quartet, <i><span lang="it">Concertino</span></i>, and a concerto
for piano and wind instruments, in which he tried all sorts
of experiments. He believes in <em>absolute music</em>, and has
written these without <em>program</em>, making the music express
what he has to say. Whether he has succeeded, must be
laid before Judge Time. He is supreme master of orchestration,
and is largely responsible for treating each instrument
as though it were playing a solo, which we described
as poly-instrumentation. We should not have enjoyed
Stravinsky as a neighbor, for he begged, borrowed or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>bought every kind of instrument and learned all their
tricks by trying them out himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>We know very little of what is going on in Russia today,
but Serge Prokofiev, one of the younger Russian composers,
has left his home and lives in Paris where his works are
often given. He has written piano concertos, violin concertos,
and the best we have heard from his pen is a chorus
with orchestral accompaniment, <cite><span lang="fr">Sept, ils sont Sept</span></cite> (<cite>Seven,
they are seven</cite>). He has also written ballets and operas.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fellow-student with Serge Prokofiev in the Petrograd
conservatory was Nicolai Miaskovsky, now living in Moscow
where he heads the musical movement. His principal
works are symphonies, one of which was played in Paris
by a countryman, Lazare Saminsky, in June, 1925.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another young composer whose piano sonatas have come
out of Russia is Samuel Feinberg. They are somewhat
in the style of Scriabin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two Tcherepnins, father and son, are living in Paris.
The son, Alexander, has written chamber music in 20th
century style.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Poland</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In modern Poland, Karol Szymanowski (1883) has written
symphonies, chamber music, songs, piano sonatas and
many other piano pieces which reflect Polish national
color and French impressionism (See Page <a href='#Page_520'>520</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Lady Dean Paul, who writes under the name of Poldowski,
although living in London, is really a Pole. (Page
<a href='#Page_439'>439</a>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Tadeusz Iarecki, of New York City, recently received
a prize in Poland for writing the best composition by a
native composer. This same quartet took the first Berkshire
Chamber Music Prize (1918) and was published in
New York by a society whose object is the publication of
American Chamber Music.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>Alexander Tansman (1892) a young Pole has met with
unusual success in Paris, where he writes works for orchestra,
chamber music and ballet.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Arnold Schoenberg, Musical Anarchist</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Arnold Schoenberg, born in Vienna (1874), taught himself
until he was twenty. He then studied with Alexander
von Zemlinsky, who later became his brother-in-law. Zemlinsky
once pointed him out saying, “He is in his early
twenties and I have taught him all I know; he brought
me an orchestral work recently for which he had to paste
two pieces of score paper together to write out his score,
so large an orchestra had he employed!” This was his tone
poem, <cite>Pelleas and Melisande</cite>, first performed in 1904. To
this early period belong some songs, a song cycle with
orchestra on texts by Jens Peter Jacobsen, <cite>Gurrelieder</cite>, and
the sextet, <cite><span lang="de">Verklärte Nacht</span></cite> (<cite>Illumined Night</cite>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Both Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler were his
friends, and through Mahler’s efforts many of his compositions
were performed. His string quartet was played in
America by the Flonzaley Quartet. His Chamber Symphony,
and his second string quartet, with solo voice, performed
(1924) at the Berkshire Chamber Music Festival,
belong to this same period.</p>

<p class='c008'>So far, all that Schoenberg composed was based more or
less on models of the past, but being naturally an anarchist
in music he tried to escape from doing what others
had done. Instead of writing works that took fifty minutes
to play like his string quartet (in one movement),
he wrote five orchestral pieces and piano pieces that were
mere suggestions of compositions, so short were they. He
cut out all development of themes, all old forms, all feeling
for tonality, writing in the twelve-tone scale which
we explained as <em>atonality</em>; he built his chords in intervals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>of fourths instead of thirds, and purposely changed all the
rules of harmony; he distorted all the intervals, using a
seventh or ninth instead of the octave, and making every
fourth and fifth a half step larger or smaller than was
customary. His melodies are marked by large skips and
queer intervals, but when one once knows his language, by
its very queerness, it is easily recognized as Schoenberg’s.
Although he has broken away from the slavery of old traditions,
he may have “jumped out of the frying-pan into
the fire”!</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite><span lang="fr">Pierrot Lunaire</span></cite>, a cycle of twenty-one songs with
chamber music accompaniment, he uses a curious effect
for the voice “which must be neither sung nor spoken.”
This same effect he uses in chorus in his music drama,
<cite><span lang="de">Die Glückliche Hand</span></cite> (<cite>The Lucky Hand</cite>) for which he also
wrote the libretto. Although this and another music
drama <cite><span lang="de">Erwartung</span></cite> (<cite>The Awaiting</cite>) were begun in 1909,
they were both performed for the first time in 1924 in
Vienna. This long delay was due to the prejudice against
the work of this innovator, who on the one hand has been
laughed at, scorned, and reviled, and on the other praised
to the skies by a small group of disciples and imitators
whose works sound very much like their teacher’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among these pupils are Egon Wellesz (1885) who more
than the other disciples has broken away from the master.
He has gone his way in writing music for the stage and
combining the old ideas of ballet and orchestral music with
Greek drama in a modern dance drama. He has also written
interesting chamber and orchestral music. Dr. Wellesz is
also an authority on musical history; he has written many
books and articles on the subject, especially on early opera,
Byzantine and Oriental music. He has written a book on
Schoenberg (1921).</p>

<p class='c008'>Alban Berg (1885), also a Schoenberg pupil, has written
unusually fine chamber music and a new opera, <cite>Wozzek</cite>, fragments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>of which were played at a festival in Prague (Czecho-Slovakia)
in May, 1925, by the International Society of
Contemporary Music, a movement most valuable in encouraging
and developing modern music. This society
holds yearly meetings in Europe, at which are heard the
works of all the young composers of the world, each country
having a branch, which sends its share of new works to
make the festival’s programs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Others of the Schoenberg group are Anton von Webern
(1883), Paul Pisk, Karl Horovitz (1884–1925), Ernest
Krenek, and Ernest Toch (1887).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Erich Korngold</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Erich Wolfgang Korngold (1898) startled the musical
world, just before the War, by the astonishing compositions
he wrote as a little boy. Among these were orchestral
works and a piano sonata of extraordinary promise. He
was born in Vienna and is the son of a musician and musical
critic. Young Korngold is known in America as the
composer of <cite><span lang="de">Die Todte Stadt</span></cite> (<cite>The Dead City</cite>) an opera in
which the soprano, Maria Jeritza, made her first appearance
at the Metropolitan Opera House. In many ways the
opera goes back to the old pre-Wagner form and is full of
melody, unusual in a young 20th century composer! He
has written other operas bordering on the lighter Viennese
operetta and has kept away from the Schoenberg influence.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Modern German Music</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Richard Strauss was the last of the great classic school
of German composers, which for two hundred years had
led the world in music. Curious as it seems, he has not
influenced directly the younger composers, who turned to
Debussy, Busoni, Schoenberg and Stravinsky. (Page <a href='#Page_410'>410</a>.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Busoni the Great</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Ferruccio Busoni (1866–1924) although an Italian, had a
strong influence in two fields of German music, that of
piano playing and composing. He lived in Berlin and was
one of the brilliant thinkers and musicians of the period.
He left chamber music and orchestral works, also several
operas, one of which, <cite>The Harlequin</cite>, finished just before
his untimely death, combines traditional form with radical
ideas. His sonatinas for piano and a set of studies
on American <cite>Indian Themes</cite> are important. He made a
deep study of all methods, old and new, and gave his
pupils the advantage of this wide experience.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the young Germans are not copying the huge
symphonic form of Bruckner and Mahler, these two have
gained greatly in popularity and are serving as models.
Hans Pfitzner (1869), opera composer, is one of the most
German of the living composers of the pre-war period;
Franz Schreker (1878), an Austrian, living in Berlin, has
taught many of the younger composers. He writes operas
and songs. Schoenberg, although in Vienna, is felt even in
Berlin.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hindemith</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Of the young Germans, Paul Hindemith is the most
important. He was born in 1895 and according to Riemann,
“is the freshest and most full-blooded talent among
the younger German composers.” He seems to satisfy
the two factions, for he is not too radical for the Old or
too old-fashioned for the New, so as Lawrence Gilman
says, “he carries water on both shoulders.... He seems
to be able to write polytonally or atonally if he chooses,
and also to write as the Academics might observe, like a
gentleman. Richard Strauss is reported to have said to
him: ‘Why do you write atonally when you have talent?’”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>Today he is viola player in the Amar Quartet, but he
has played in cafés, in the “movies,” dance halls, operetta
theatres, and jazz bands! Although only thirty, he has
many chamber music pieces to his credit and three dramatic
works. His success has been tremendous.</p>

<p class='c008'>A society to further an interest in the new music was
founded by Hermann Scherchen and Eduard Erdmann.
Scherchen created a sensation in Berlin just before the
war by conducting Schoenberg’s <cite><span lang="fr">Pierrot Lunaire</span></cite>, and
after having been a prisoner of war in Russia he came
back with renewed purpose of bringing the new music to
the public. He has published a few songs and a string
quartet. His right-hand man Erdmann, besides being a
pianist, has written a symphony, the first attempt of a
youth without orchestral experience, which astonished the
audience as a combination of Richard Strauss, Schoenberg,
“to which is added a portion of genuine Erdmann flavor,”
says Hugo Leichtentritt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another young German is Heinz Tiessen (1887), who is
writing besides piano music in <em>atonality</em>, incidental music to
a drama by Hauptman, and songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Philipp Jarnach (1892), a pupil of Busoni, Spanish by
birth, educated in Paris, lives in Berlin and writes in the
new style. Kurt Weill (1900) is also a gifted Busoni-ite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ernst Toch (1887), Viennese by birth, who lives in Germany
has written string quartets, sonatas, concertos, and
a symphony.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heinrich Kaminsky is accepted in Germany as the composer
who is trying to build a bridge from Bach to modern
times. His <cite>Concerto Grosso</cite> for double orchestra commands
great respect.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hungary—Bartók and Kodály</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Béla Bartók (1881) and his friend Soltan Kodály (1882)
have done much to bring Hungarian folk music into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>modern world, for they are steeped in folk tunes, which
they use with skill and imagination. Bartók has written
a short opera, two ballets, orchestral works, string quartets,
violin sonata, and many piano compositions. His children’s
pieces are delightful, based as they are on Hungarian
folk tunes.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have spoken at length of the gypsy music of the
Hungarians brought to us by Brahms, Liszt and Sarasate
(violinist and composer). We also told you that the
Hungarians were Magyars. Adjoran Otvos, in the <cite>League of
Composers Review</cite> says: “Bartók and Kodály have accomplished
a pioneer work of quite a different nature, an exploration
into the folk music of Hungary which has yielded
a collection of historic significance, the most important
and only authentic one made in that country.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bartók, poor and supported only by a scholarship,
started in 1905, an investigation of the music of his race.
Spending a week with a friend in the country, he heard a
servant, while at work, singing a tune quite different from
the hybrid (mixed breed) gypsy airs which pass for Magyar
music, in Hungary and elsewhere. He contrived to conceal
himself and day after day, while the servant worked,
recorded a number of songs whose primitive character,
he at once recognized. With this impetus, he embarked on a
tour which lasted over two years, as long as his money
held out. On his journeys among the peasants he met
Kodály, out on a similar mission of research. Without
previous inkling of each other’s aims, they proceeded
together, recording the ancient songs of the Magyars in
the compilation which is famous today.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ernest von Dohnányi</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Ernest von Dohnányi (1877) a noted pianist and composer
of Hungary has spent most of his life in Berlin and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>has toured Europe and America in piano recitals. He has
written many works for orchestra, chamber music, piano
and opera, all of which show more influence of Brahms
than of men of his own land. He has been engaged as conductor
of the State Symphony Orchestra of New York
for the season 1925–26.</p>

<p class='c008'>A twenty-eight year old pupil of Béla Bartók, Georg
Kosa, shows decided gifts in his first orchestral work,
<cite>Six Pieces for Orchestra</cite>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Czech School</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Czech school founded by Smetana and Dvorak and
Zdenko Fibich (1850–1900) and continued by Vitezslav
Novak (1870), Josef Suk (1874), and Vaclar Stepan (1889),
has had a rebirth in the 20th century. Leos Janacek, although
over seventy, is the leading spirit; Rudolf Karel
(1881), a pupil of Dvorak, Bohuslav Martinu, a follower of
Stravinsky, and Ernest Krenek (1902), a pupil of Schreker,
and Alois Haba (1893), pupil of Novak and Schreker are
the working forces. (Janacek died in 1928.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Quarter-Tone Man</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Alois Haba first wrote chamber music, then he tried
some interesting experiments for which he is known as
the “quarter-tone man.” We have heard of quarter-tones
among the Hindus and Arabs (Chapter VI) and as the
human ear has become more educated, the possibility of
dividing the scale into quarter-tones is much discussed,
and seems to be the next step in developing music along
the line of overtones (see above). Did you ever realize
that as with eyes that are far-sighted or near-sighted, ears
may vary too, in the amount they hear? Most people
think that every one hears alike, but this is not so. Stravinsky
was one day sitting with a friend on the shore of a
Swiss Lake near which he lived. The friend said the water
was calm and still, but Stravinsky heard, a definite musical
sound! Many of these musical sounds unheard by
our ears he has shown us in his music. In the same way it
is said that Haba has an extraordinarily keen ear and in
trying to express what he hears, he has written two string
quartets in the quarter-tone system. Stringed instruments
are not in <em>tempered</em> scales and lend themselves to
any division of the interval, into third-tones, as Busoni
tried, and quarter-tones as Haba has written. But he
has gone further and has made a piano on which quarter-tones
may be played. This may prove to be the basis of
music of the future, or it may be merely one of the numerous
experiments without lasting value.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Italy and the New Order</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>For many centuries Italy has been known as producing
the opera of the world. Of late years opera has not been
considered the highest form of musical art, so with the
coming of the 20th century, a group of composers has been
working in Italy, trying to get away from the old opera
writing and to develop along the line of orchestral and
chamber music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alfredo Casella (1883) is perhaps responsible for this
movement for he lived in Paris for many years and came in
contact with Debussy’s music and the modern movement
there. One of his earliest works to attract attention in
America was <cite>War Films</cite>, a series of orchestral pictures
that were very real. He has written piano pieces, chamber
music and orchestral works and one of his latest is a
ballet, in which it looks as though he were leaving his
path of dissonance for in this he has used folk song as a
basis for a new and delightful expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>G. Francesco Malipiero (1882) has written two string
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>quartets, one of which received the Coolidge Prize of the
Berkshire Chamber Music Festival; in these he has broken
away from the large sonata form. He has also written
lovely songs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ildebrando Pizzetti (1880) has written two operas on
texts by Gabrielle d’Annunzio called <cite><span lang="fr">La Nave</span></cite> (<cite>The Ship</cite>)
and <cite>Fedra</cite>. His most recent work, <cite><span lang="it">Fra Ghirardo</span></cite> was performed
at the Metropolitan in 1929.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ottorino Respighi (1879) wrote operas in true Italian
fashion, but deserted them for chamber music and orchestral
works. <cite>Pines of Rome</cite> and <cite>Fountains of Rome</cite>, we
hear often. His <cite>Violin Concerto in Gregorian Mode</cite> was
played by Albert Spalding. His latest opera, <cite><span lang="it">La Campana
Sommersa</span></cite> (<cite>The Sunken Bell</cite>) was given at the Metropolitan
in 1928.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these men show the traces of the Italian love of
melody, with the influence of French impressionism, and
German romanticism.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two or three of these modern Italians now live in Paris,
among them Santoliquido and Vincenzo Davico, both
song writers.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now <cite>Noah’s Ark</cite> has been put to music by a young
Italian, Vittorio Rieti with wit and humor, in a work for
orchestra, played in May, 1925, at the Prague Festival.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Manuel de Falla</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In Spain, one man who has continued along the lines of
Albeniz and Granados is Manuel de Falla (1876). He
studied first with Felipe Pedrell, the father of the modern
Spanish school. In 1907 he went to Paris where he met
Debussy and Dukas. He wrote a ballet <cite><span lang="es">El Amor Brujo</span></cite>
(<cite>Love, the Magician</cite>). He combines a picturesque Spanish
folk style with a modern way of writing music. One
of his most attractive works is a scenic arrangement from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>a chapter in <cite>Don Quixote</cite>, Cervantes’ masterpiece, as
Spanish as a Spanish fandango. It is a marionette ballet
called <cite><span lang="es">El Retablo de Maese Pedro</span></cite> (<cite>Master Pedro’s Puppet
Show</cite>). It is a charming work and you will like it. His
writings have simplicity, and freshness, which can come
only from deep study and so perfect a mastery of art that
there is no self-consciousness. He is a true nationalist
delighting in Spanish color; his music has nobility and
humanness as well as charm.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Netherlands</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Clarence G. Hamilton says in his <cite>Outlines of Music History</cite>
that Netherland composers are patriotically laboring
for a distinctive school. Few names are known outside
of Holland, with the exception of Alphonse Diepenbroek
(1862–1921), Dirk Schaefer (1874), Sem Dresden (1881),
James Zwart (1892), Julius Roentgen (1855), who has
collected many of the Dutch folk songs, and Dopper, conductor
and composer for orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Belgium, Jan Blockx (1851–1912) wrote successful
operas and chamber music; Paul Gilson (1865) has written
orchestral and chamber music works which have won
him a foremost place among modern Flemish composers;
both César Franck and Guillaume Lekeu were Flemish
(Belgian); Joseph Jongen, while not writing in the very
modern style, is well known for his symphonic poems,
chamber music, a ballet <cite>S’Arka</cite> (produced at the Théâtre de
la Monnaie, Brussels), songs, piano pieces and organ
works.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Switzerland</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Jaques Dalcroze (1865) is better known as the inventor
of Eurythmics, a system of music study from the standpoint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>of rhythm, than as composer, but he has written many
charming songs in folk style. Gustave Doret (1866), has
written several operas, cantatas, oratorios which have
been performed in his native land and in Paris. Hans
Huber (1852) has a long list of compositions in all forms.
Ernest Bloch, though born in Switzerland is living in
America and is by far the greatest innovator of these
Swiss writers. Emile Blanchet, is a writer of piano music,
rather more poetic than of the very modern style. Arthur
Honegger, the foremost young composer of France, though
born in Havre, is often claimed as a Swiss composer, because
his parents are Swiss. Rudolph Ganz, pianist, composer
and conductor in America was born in Switzerland.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>England</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When we come to Frederick Delius (1863) we meet first
with a new feeling in English music. He has written orchestral
pieces (<cite>Brigg Fair</cite>, concertos, <cite>On Hearing the First
Cuckoo in Spring</cite>), chorals (<cite>Appalachia</cite>, <cite>The Song of the
High Hills</cite> and others), chamber music and songs. He
was the first Englishman to write in the impressionistic
way. His opera <cite>The Village Romeo and Juliet</cite> is very modern
in form, and the music interprets the story and is not
built like the Italian operas.</p>

<p class='c008'>Delius is of Dutch-French-German stock, but was born
in England, and has lived there and in France. He never
tried for music posts or prizes but has remained apart to
compose. Though his work often sounds like the 18th
century virginal music, he is not conscious of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has, in his chorals, done some of the best work since
Beethoven, says one biographer, and in them are strength,
power and beauty, quite different indeed from the sensuous
and sweet smaller works. He is a careful worker, a
great idealist, and a truly great musician.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>There are many well-trained musicians like Holbrooke
and Hurlstone who have done much for music in England
but this chapter belongs to those who are carrying on 20th
century ideas.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among them is Vaughan Williams (1872) to whom folk
music is as bread to others. He uses it whenever he can.
In his <cite>London Symphony</cite>, his most famous work, he has
caught the spirit of the city and it is a milestone of the
early 20th century. Isn’t it curious that the most important
work written on the poetry of our American Walt Whitman
is by an Englishman! This is the <cite>Sea Symphony</cite> for orchestra
and chorus, an impressive work by Vaughan Williams.
He has also written <cite>Five Mystical Songs</cite>, <cite>Willow Wood</cite>
(cantata), <cite>On Wenlock Edge</cite> (six songs), <cite>Norfolk Rhapsodies</cite>,
<cite>In the Fen Country</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Granville Bantock (1868) is a musical liberator for he
was the first to free English composers from the old style
of Mendelssohn and the new kind of classicism of Brahms,
and release them to write as they felt. He wrote music on
the <cite>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</cite> (Persian), <cite>Sappho</cite>, <cite>Pierrot
of the Minute</cite>, <cite>Fifine at the Fair</cite>, <cite>Hebredean</cite> (Scotch) <cite>Symphony</cite>,
which shows his love of Scotch music, and many
other works. He succeeded Elgar at Birmingham University
and has made valuable studies and collections of Folk
Music.</p>

<p class='c008'>A lover of chamber music, the fantasy and fancy, is
Frank Bridge (1879). He is a thorough musician and has
written <cite>The Sea</cite>, the <cite>Dance Rhapsodies</cite> for orchestra, symphonic
poem <cite>Isabella</cite> on Keats’ poem of the same name.
<cite>Three Idylls for Strings</cite> and other works.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gustave Holst (1874) whose original name was von
Holst although he is not of German descent, was a pupil
of Sir Charles V. Stanford and is now an inspiring teacher
and conductor. He has had many posts and has written
many important works: an opera, <cite>The Perfect Fool</cite>, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span><cite>Hymn to Jesus</cite>, one of the finest choral works of the century,
<cite>The Planets</cite>, a very fine orchestral work, military
band music, songs and part songs, some of which are
written with violin accompaniment,—a charming idea!</p>

<p class='c008'>John Ireland (1879), has written a fine piano sonata and
a violin sonata, <cite>Decorations</cite> (a collection of small pieces),
<cite><span lang="it">Chelsea Reach</span></cite>, <cite>Ragamuffin</cite> and <cite>Soho Forenoons</cite>, chamber
music and orchestral pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cyril Scott (1879) was trained in Germany. He is a mixture
of French impressionistic writing and Oriental mysticism,
as you can see from the titles of his pieces: <cite>Lotus
Land</cite> (Lotus is an Egyptian flower), <cite>The Garden of Soul
Sympathy</cite>, and <cite>Riki Tiki Tavi</cite>, a setting of Kipling’s little
chap of the Jungle Book, which is very delightful. He is
one of the first English Impressionists who paved the way
for the young English School. He has made many interesting
experiments in modern harmony and rhythm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arnold Bax (1883), of Irish parentage, is a gifted and
poetic composer who has written many things in small and
large forms, chamber music and piano sonatas, <cite>The Garden
of Fand</cite> for orchestra, <cite>Fatherland</cite>, a chorus with orchestra
and other things, all of which show him to have a creative
imagination and rich musical personality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lord Berners (1883) (Gerald Hugh Tyrwhitt-Wilson),
a lover of the works of Stravinsky and Casella of the modern
Russian and Italian Schools, was trained in an old-fashioned
way, and then Stravinsky and Casella, seeing in
his music possibilities for freer writing, encouraged him
to break away from old ways, and he became one of the
most modern of the young English composers. He writes
interestingly in caricature and sarcasm, in fact he is a musical
cartoonist in such pieces as the <cite>Funeral March of a
Pet Canary</cite>, <cite>Funeral March of a Rich Aunt</cite>, full of originality
and of fun in choosing subjects. He wrote, too, three
pieces, <cite>Hatred</cite>, <cite>Laughter</cite> and <cite>A Sigh</cite> which are amazing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>musical studies. His work is interesting because of its
daring in his very correct surroundings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eugene Goossens (1893) of Flemish ancestry, understands
dissonance and modern combinations, which he
uses with fascinating charm. His violin sonata and <cite>Nature
Pieces</cite> for piano show his depth of feeling, his <cite>Kaleidescopes</cite>
(12 children’s pieces) show his humor, love of the
grotesque, and <cite>Four Conceits</cite>, his power to be musically
sarcastic. His <cite>Five Impressions of a Holiday</cite> and <cite>Two
Sketches for String Quartet</cite> are so delightful that modern
music would have lost much without them. He is a gifted
conductor and has directed concerts in London, in Rochester,
New York, and is engaged as guest conductor of the
New York Symphony in 1925–26.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arthur Bliss (1891) like Stravinsky, whom he admires, is
the <em>enfant terrible</em> of English music and is not held down
by any rule or fixed standards except that of good taste.
He uses instruments in daring ways, and shows a natural
knowledge of them. One of his pieces is for an unaccompanied
<i><span lang="fr">Cor Anglais</span></i> (<em>English horn</em>). Among his pieces are
<cite>The Committee</cite>, <cite>In the Tube (Subway) at Oxford Circus</cite>, <cite>At
the Ball</cite>. He wrote a <cite>Color Symphony</cite>, so-called because when
composing it, he experienced a play of color sensation,
although he did not write it to be used with the color organ,
as does Scriabin in <cite>Prometheus</cite>. He is a most daring experimenter,
and altogether an interesting young musician. In
<cite>Rout</cite>, a gay piece for voice and chamber orchestra, he used
meaningless syllables in place of words. He spent several
years in Los Angeles, but has returned to England.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>America</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In America we not only hear the works of all the people
of whom we have spoken in this chapter, but among our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>composers are a few who show marked twentieth century
ways of composing. Some of them are American born,
some have adopted the country, but all are working for
the advancement of American music: Loeffler, our first
impressionist, Bloch, Carpenter, Gruenberg, Whithorne,
Morris, Jacobi, Marion Bauer, Eichheim, Carl Engel, Ornstein,
Varese, Salzedo, Ruggles, Cowell, Antheil, and Copland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several organizations have worked for the cause of
modern music by presenting concerts devoted to works by
contemporary Europeans and Americans. The <cite><span lang="it">Pro Musica</span></cite>
Society has been responsible for the visits to this country
of Maurice Ravel, Bela Bartok, Darius Milhaud, Alexandre
Tansman and Arthur Honegger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <cite>League of Composers</cite> (founded 1923) has had many
notable “first performances” of compositions by Schoenberg,
Bloch, Bartok, Stravinsky, Gruenberg, Malipiero,
Hindemith, Copland, de Falla, Whithorne, Carrillo, etc.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Our Good-Bye</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>This book has been longer than it should have been, yet
our sins have been of omission rather than commission.
But if we have only made you realize that the world cannot
stand still, that music is always growing whether we
understand it or not, and the good is handed on to the next
generation even though much “falls by the wayside,” we
will not have written in vain.</p>
